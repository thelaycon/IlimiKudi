Safeguard your business using Paystack
Online payments enable ambitious companies in Africa to accept payments from customers safely and securely, no matter where they are in the world.
However, like all good things, online payments come with risks—including cyber fraud.
Cyber fraud continues to rise both in Africa and globally, as bad actors adopt increasingly sophisticated tactics to target vulnerable businesses and individuals. With threats evolving daily, it’s more important than ever for businesses to implement proactive, robust measures to stay ahead of cyber risks.
Paystack helps protect merchants from fraud through comprehensive security and fraud prevention features. In this blog post, we’ll introduce some of our key security tools, show you how to use them to reduce your fraud risk, and share practical tips to help safeguard your business.
The growing threat of cyber fraud
Cyber fraud is an online threat in which attackers use the internet to deceive individuals or businesses to steal money, sensitive information, or account access. As technology advances, cyber fraud has become a persistent risk for anyone using the internet—whether for shopping, banking, or running a business.
To understand the scope of this threat, here are some of the most common types of cyber fraud affecting businesses today.
Shareable Takeaway
Cyber fraud occurs when a bad actor uses the internet to trick people or businesses to steal money or sensitive information.

Synthetic identity fraud
Synthetic identity fraud occurs when a fraudster creates a fake identity by combining real and fabricated information, such as a genuine National Identification Number with a fake name, date of birth, or address. This 'synthetic' identity appears legitimate but doesn’t belong to any real person.
Bad actors use these identities to open bank accounts, apply for loans, or carry out other financial crimes. Financial systems may approve these applications, unknowingly allowing bad actors to build credit histories under synthetic identities and ultimately withdraw large sums without intent to repay.
This type of fraud is challenging to detect because it doesn’t link to a real individual, making businesses vulnerable to significant financial losses.
Shareable Takeaway
Synthetic identity fraud uses fake identities to trick financial systems into approving loans or accounts, making it hard to detect and prevent.

Chargeback fraud
Chargeback fraud or 'friendly fraud' occurs when a customer makes a legitimate purchase but then disputes the transaction with their bank to receive a refund. They may falsely claim they didn’t authorize the purchase, didn’t receive the item, or that the item wasn’t as described.
Chargeback fraud is costly and labor-intensive for businesses, as it requires gathering evidence to dispute the claim with payment processors. Recurrent cases can lead to penalties, increased transaction fees, or even account suspension.
For example, in 2023, a large payment’s company in Nigeria reportedly lost up to ₦30 billion to chargeback fraud due to a system glitch, highlighting the potential scale of financial losses that businesses can face.
Internal threats
Internal threats originate from individuals within a business, such as employees or contractors, who misuse their access privileges. Examples include an employee stealing customer data to sell externally, or manipulating financial records to commit fraud.
These threats are challenging to detect as insiders have a deeper understanding of company operations. Without adequate controls, businesses can suffer severe consequences, including financial losses, regulatory fines, and reputational damage.
For example, an employee of one of Nigeria’s largest banks reportedly diverted up to ₦40 billion into 98 bank accounts he classified as beneficiaries. Similarly, in Kenya, a staff member of the country’s largest bank allegedly collaborated with bad actors to defraud the bank of up to $2.1 million.
Phishing attacks
Phishing remains one of the most common cyber threats, where attackers impersonate trusted entities like banks or well-known companies to trick individuals into revealing sensitive information. These attempts often come through emails, SMS messages ('smishing'), or fake websites resembling legitimate ones.
Victims may be lured into sharing login credentials, ATM PINs, or financial information. The consequences for businesses can be severe: a single employee falling victim to a phishing attack could expose company accounts, customer data, and proprietary information, leading to significant financial and reputational damage.
How Paystack keeps you safe
What happens behind the scenes when you pay online with Paystack, and how exactly do we keep you secure? Let’s find out.
Learn how Paystack keeps you safe
Beyond financial losses, these types of fraud erode customer trust and harm a company’s reputation. Many incidents go unreported due to reputational concerns, which can worsen the problem by limiting awareness and collaboration. Proactive fraud prevention is essential, and Paystack is dedicated to helping businesses stay protected with tools designed to secure operations.
Paystack security features for fraud prevention
To help protect your business from cyber fraud, Paystack offers several security tools designed to secure your account, transactions, and customer data.
IP whitelisting
IP whitelisting is a security feature that allows you limit access to your Paystack account to only a specific list of trusted IP addresses. It lets you control which computers or networks are allowed to interact with your business account, even if they have your secret key.
A secret key is like a private password that only your business and Paystack know. It’s used to authorize transactions and requests, ensuring they’re coming from a trusted source. If someone outside your business gains access to your secret key, they could potentially make unauthorized requests.
IP whitelisting makes it such that even if a request is made using your secret key, Paystack checks if it’s coming from a whitelisted IP address. If the IP address isn’t on your list of trusted sources, the request is automatically blocked, preventing unwanted access.
IP whitelisting is particularly valuable for businesses handling sensitive financial transactions, as it helps secure your account from unknown or malicious sources.
To enable IP whitelisting, go to the API Keys and Webhook Settings tab in your Paystack Dashboard and add up to ten IP addresses for each environment (live and test). Also, refer to our comprehensive support article, which will guide you through the setup process.
Once activated, this security measure forms a crucial barrier, protecting your business from potential threats and ensuring compliance with industry best practices.
 			IPs can be whitelisted from the Paystack Dashboard 		
Two-factor authentication (2FA)
Two-factor authentication (2FA) adds an extra layer of security to your business account. Instead of relying solely on a password, 2FA requires a second step to verify your identity—usually a unique code sent to your phone or generated by an authentication app. This means that even if someone has your password, they can’t access your account without also having your phone or authentication device.
To protect your account and transactions, we strongly encourage all Paystack Dashboard users to enable 2FA across their integration. This added security makes it significantly harder for unauthorized users to gain access, even if they manage to steal your password.
We especially recommend using Paystack Passkeys with 2FA. Passkeys let you securely log into your Dashboard using biometrics like face recognition, fingerprint, or screen lock, so you don’t need to remember or manage passwords.
To set up Passkeys, go to the Profile tab on the Settings page of your Paystack Dashboard, scroll to the Authentication section, and click 'Add a passkey.'
 			Passkeys allow you to securely log into the Paystack Dashboard 		
Role-based access controls
Role-based access controls allow you to manage permissions for each user on the Paystack Dashboard based on their role within your organization, ensuring that only authorized individuals can access sensitive data and perform critical functions. It reduces the risk of internal fraud and unintentional errors by restricting access according to specific job responsibilities. Paystack provides six default roles—Admin, Operations, Developer Support, Customer Support, Direct Debit Admin, and Signatory—each with distinct permissions tailored to different levels of responsibility.
If the default roles do not fully meet your organization’s needs, you can create custom roles by selecting specific permissions through the Team tab on the Dashboard. To get started and for setup instructions on assigning or customizing roles, please refer to the 'Manage Roles' section in your Dashboard as well as this support article.
 			Role-based access controls reduce the risk of fraud 		
Transfer approvals
To protect your account from unauthorized transfers, Paystack offers secure approval options, including One-Time Passwords (OTP) and URL-based approvals. These features act as a safety net, requiring a final verification step before money can be transferred from out of your Paystack account.
With Transfer OTP, a unique code is sent to your email or to a specified device, like your phone. An authorized user must enter this code to complete the transfer. This ensures that only someone with access to your secure device can approve transactions.
For a faster, hands-off option, URL-based approvals send a secure link to the approver. With a quick click, the approver can either confirm or reject the transfer request. This is ideal for businesses managing multiple transactions, as it requires minimal manual intervention while still ensuring security.
By setting up these approval methods, you can keep your business safe from unauthorized transfers and gain control over your high-value transactions. For detailed setup instructions, refer to our transfer approval guide.
Shareable Takeaway
Paystack offers a range of security features, including IP Whitelisting, 2FA, and Transfer Approvals, all designed to work together to minimize the risk of fraud for businesses.

Risk Assessment Management System (RAMS) works behind the scenes to prevent fraud
Beyond these readily accessible features, Paystack also has some extra fraud detection and remediation tools that work continuously behind the scenes to identify and mitigate risks.
One of these safeguards is our Risk Assessment Management System (RAMS), an in-house fraud detection and prevention tool that operates quietly in the background.
RAMS uses a smart set of rules customized for each payment type, looking at details like transaction patterns, business profiles, and industry norms to spot potential risks. By tracking each step of every transaction, RAMS makes quick decisions on whether a transaction should go through or if it needs further review, giving your business strong protection at every stage.
Comprehensive fraud remediation process
While Paystack’s Risk Assessment Management System (RAMS) is effective at catching and flagging potential fraud in real time, some cases require a deeper level of support. To help merchants facing elevated fraud levels, Paystack has also established a proactive fraud remediation process.
Our team regularly monitors fraud patterns for each merchant and sets tailored fraud thresholds based on factors like business size and industry. For example, a large lending business may have higher fraud ratios due to frequent fraud reports from customers who don’t recognize loan repayment charges. We account for these unique factors when setting limits for each business.
Some key metrics Paystack monitors for each merchant include:
Fraud Value: This is the total value of transactions reported as fraudulent within a specific timeframe.
Fraud Ratio: This is the percentage of the total transaction value that is reported as fraudulent over the same period.
Our automated system continually calculates each merchant’s fraud metrics and flags accounts that exceed the set thresholds for immediate review. If a merchant’s fraud metrics cross these thresholds, we start a collaborative, hands-on process to bring fraud levels back down to acceptable limits.
This step-by-step process includes:
Notification: Paystack notifies the merchant of any breach of fraud thresholds.
Engagement and investigation: Our fraud team collaborates with the merchant to identify the root causes of elevated fraud metrics.
Remediation: Together, we develop a targeted action plan to address vulnerabilities, complete with a timeline for implementation.
Monitoring: After the remediation steps are implemented, Paystack continues to monitor the merchant’s fraud metrics to ensure sustained improvement.
This approach helps merchants reduce fraud, protect their customers, and strengthen their overall security posture.

Other tactical steps businesses can take to protect against risk
While Paystack’s processes provide a robust layer of defense, it’s helpful for businesses to implement proactive steps on their own to further reduce cyber fraud risks and reinforce their internal security practices.
Enforce strong KYC requirements for your customers
KYC, or 'Know Your Customer,' is the process of verifying customers’ identities to prevent fraud and comply with regulatory requirements. Effective KYC involves collecting essential information—such as names, contact details, and national IDs—and verifying them against official databases.
For example, Nigerian businesses may use the Bank Verification Number (BVN) to confirm identities, while businesses in Ghana might use the Tax Identification Number and those in South Africa the South African ID number. In Kenya, acceptable KYC documents include National Identity Cards, passports, and driver’s licenses.
Implementing strong KYC practices not only helps your business meet legal requirements but also reduces the risk of fraud by ensuring you know who you’re transacting with.
Use complex passwords or passphrases
Setting complex passwords is a vital yet often overlooked step in protecting business accounts from unauthorized access. Strong passwords use a mix of uppercase and lowercase letters, numbers, and special characters, making them harder for attackers to guess or crack. Alternatively, a passphrase—a memorable sentence or phrase from a song, book, or movie—can also be effective.
When providing temporary access to your dashboard for external parties like developers or consultants, if you must share credentials (though not recommended), change the password immediately afterward to maintain security. Enforcing strong password policies makes it more difficult for unauthorized users to breach accounts, protecting customer data and financial information.
Build rule-based fraud detection systems
A rule-based fraud detection system is a security tool designed to identify potentially fraudulent activity. It relies on predefined rules or conditions based on patterns or behaviors often associated with fraud, such as multiple transactions within a short period or the use of several different payment methods from the same account.
When a transaction meets any of these preset rules, the system automatically flags it for review, sometimes by holding the transaction until it can be verified. Businesses can benefit greatly by developing these tools or processes internally, tailoring them to their specific risks and transaction patterns.
Implementing a rule-based detection system provides an early line of defense against fraud by catching unusual patterns that may not be immediately noticeable to humans. These systems can operate in real time, allowing your business to pause or review suspicious transactions before losses occur.
Segregation of Duties (SoD)
Segregation of Duties (SoD) is a security practice designed to ensure that no single individual has control over every step of a critical task. By dividing responsibilities among multiple people, SoD helps prevent fraud by ensuring that sensitive actions—like initiating and approving a payment—cannot be completed without oversight from others.
For example, in implementing SoD, businesses can assign access privileges based on each user’s role. Only the business owner might have full admin rights, while other team members are given permissions specific to their responsibilities. This way, no one person has unchecked control over high-risk actions, reducing the likelihood of fraudulent activity and promoting accountability within the organization.
Shareable Takeaway
Separating responsibilities ensures no one person has control over critical actions and tasks, reducing fraud risks in the work place.

Establish strong treasury practices
Strong treasury practices involve regular monitoring and reconciliation of financial accounts to ensure all transactions are legitimate. By tracking all incoming and outgoing funds, businesses can quickly detect discrepancies that might indicate fraud or unauthorized access.
Often, fraud goes unnoticed until it shows up in financial statements at the end of a month, quarter, or year. With strong accounting frameworks in place, unusual money movements can be detected and addressed early, minimizing potential losses.
Conduct regular checks on your security systems
Businesses should regularly conduct infrastructure and security system audits. Doing this ensures that security measures put in place to detect fraud and other risks are effective and up-to-date.
Engaging internal or external auditors to review high-risk areas of your business also identifies potential vulnerabilities before they can be exploited. These audits check if current security protocols are sufficient and can reveal gaps that might not be obvious in day-to-day operations. High-risk workstreams, such as payment processing and data handling, should be reviewed frequently to ensure no vulnerabilities go unchecked.
Stay on top of chargebacks to prevent friendly fraud
Chargebacks are a safety net for customers, allowing them to dispute transactions and request refunds when something goes wrong with their order or service. This process, overseen by card networks like Mastercard and Visa as well as local regulatory bodies, is designed to protect consumers. Customers file disputes with the goal of reversing charges.
For merchants, chargebacks present both a challenge and an opportunity. They have a limited window to respond, either by accepting the chargeback or providing evidence to dispute it. If the merchant doesn’t respond within the specified timeframe, the chargeback is automatically accepted, and the refund is processed. This can lead to financial losses, even if the merchant has fulfilled their end of the transaction.
To minimize these risks, businesses must stay on top of chargebacks to ensure that they’re resolved quickly. Paystack helps by sending immediate email notifications when a dispute is raised, followed by reminder emails every four hours until the issue is resolved. This ensures merchants stay informed and can take timely action.
Friendly fraud—when customers misuse the chargeback process to get refunds for valid purchases—has become increasingly common. For instance, a customer might falsely claim they didn’t receive an item to trigger a chargeback. If businesses fail to respond promptly, they risk losing revenue unfairly. By actively monitoring and resolving chargebacks, merchants can close this loophole, protect their income, and maintain a healthier financial position.
Keep systems updated and patched
Regularly updating and patching software on devices used to access the Paystack Dashboard is essential for security. Software updates often include patches for vulnerabilities that attackers could otherwise exploit.
By keeping your operating system, applications, and security software up to date, you close security gaps that might otherwise expose your systems to unauthorized access.
Safeguard your business using Paystack
At Paystack, we’re committed to helping you stay one step ahead with a comprehensive suite of security tools and proactive fraud prevention measures. These features not only safeguard your revenue but also strengthen customer trust and loyalty, giving you a competitive advantage in a world where data security is highly valued.
However, true security is a shared responsibility. While Paystack provides built-in defences like IP whitelisting and two-factor authentication, these features work best when actively used by you and your team. By adopting strong internal practices—such as enforcing KYC, using complex passwords, and conducting regular security audits—you play a vital role in building a resilient defence against evolving threats.
We encourage you to explore the security features available in your Paystack Dashboard, activate essential tools, and establish a regular fraud prevention review process.
Together, let’s create a secure and resilient digital ecosystem where your business can thrive. For any questions on enhancing your security measures, reach out to our team at support@paystack.com—we’re here to help you protect what matters most.",blog

Build trust from day one with strong data protection
Startups and early-stage businesses have a lot on their plates—raising capital, finding product-market fit, scaling, and more. With so much to juggle, it’s easy to push concepts like data privacy and protection to the back burner. But neglecting them early on can put your business at serious risk.
A single data breach could result in hefty fines, damage customer loyalty, ruin investor relationships, and more.
Data privacy and protection safeguard businesses from threats like data breaches, identity theft, and regulatory penalties—issues that can sink a company before it even takes off.
In this article, we’ll break down the key concepts of data privacy and protection, share how to create a privacy policy, and provide actionable tips to help businesses build strong data protection frameworks from the ground up.
Data privacy and data protection are related, but distinct concepts
Data privacy and data protection are closely related, but each plays a distinct role in safeguarding your business. Both terms have specific, specialized meanings in regulatory contexts.
Data privacy refers to a set of policies defining how personal data is collected, stored, and shared responsibly and lawfully. Think of your personal data as a valuable item in your home. Data privacy is like deciding who gets to come inside and look at it—only trusted individuals, like friends or family, should be allowed in. If someone doesn’t have permission, they shouldn’t be able to see, use, or share that data.
Data protection, on the other hand, is about securing that data once it’s been collected. While privacy defines who can enter your home, data protection is like installing a security system—using tools like locks, alarms, and surveillance to keep intruders out. This includes measures like encryption, strong passwords, and firewalls, all designed to protect your data from unauthorized access or breaches.
Shareable Takeaway
Data privacy defines how personal data is collected, stored, and shared, while data protection ensures that this data is secured from unauthorized access.

Why African startups should care about data protection
For startups, ensuring data protection is crucial for building trust.
Customers won’t stick around if they fear their personal data is at risk. Similarly, investors want the assurance that their portfolio companies are operating compliantly, because data protection controls reduce regulatory risks.
Many early-stage teams think they can postpone worrying about data security, but that’s a risky gamble. If you’re building something online, it’s not a matter of if bad actors will try to breach your defenses—it’s when. And when that moment arrives, having a robust data protection strategy can make all the difference between weathering the storm or facing disaster.
There are real-life examples of companies across Africa facing the consequences of data privacy or data protection lapses. In Ghana, a ride-hailing service was fined GHS 1,900,000 for failing to prevent identity theft on its platform. In Kenya, the Office of the Data Protection Commissioner (ODPC) fined an organization KES 500,000 for using a data subject’s image without documented consent. And in Nigeria, the Nigerian Data Protection Commission (NDPC) fined a commercial bank NGN 555,800,000 for non-compliant data processing.
So how can startups ensure effective data protection? It starts with understanding the core principles that form the foundation of strong data protection practices.
How Paystack keeps you safe
What happens behind the scenes when you pay online with Paystack, and how exactly do we keep you secure? Let’s find out.
Learn how Paystack keeps you safe →
Seven principles to keep in mind when handling data
The following seven principles should form the foundation of your data protection policies.
The principle of purpose limitation: Only collect data for a clear, legitimate reason, and only use that data for that specific purpose.
The principle of lawfulness, fairness, and transparency: As a startup, you’ll collect data from customers, employees, or partners. This principle means clearly communicating what data is being collected and how it will be used and stored. Make sure data subjects are aware their data will be processed in accordance with relevant laws and understand how it will be managed, kept, and used.
The principle of data minimization: Collect only the data that is absolutely necessary. For example, if you’re running an e-commerce startup selling water bottles, you likely don’t need a customer’s passport information. More data means more responsibility, and if a breach occurs, you are more vulnerable. Audit your data to ensure all collected information is essential to your operations.
The principle of storage limitation: Only retain data for as long as it’s needed. Keeping data indefinitely creates unnecessary risk. Implement a data retention policy to manage how long each type of data is stored, and periodically delete data that falls outside of the retention policy.
The principle of accuracy: The data you collect must be accurate and kept up to date. Outdated or incorrect data can lead to poor business decisions.
The principle of integrity and confidentiality: You must take responsibility for securing the data you collect. Implement data backup processes to prevent data loss, and implement security measures like encryption, strong password policies, and two-factor authentication to protect against unauthorized access.
The principle of accountability: Your startup must be able to prove compliance with data protection regulations. It’s not enough to have good intentions—you need clear, documented processes. Being able to demonstrate compliance helps protect you against legal consequences if something goes wrong.

Supervisory Authorities (SAs) enforce data protection
These data protection principles are enforced by regulators known as Supervisory Authorities (SAs). Data protection regulations vary by country and industry, and SAs are independent authorities responsible for ensuring compliance with these regulations.
SAs check if companies are following the rules, provide advice on data protection, and handle complaints. They have the authority to investigate data breaches and take action if needed.
It’s important for companies to know which SA governs them and what regulations apply in their country. For instance, in Nigeria, companies must complete a yearly data protection compliance audit, while in Kenya and Ghana, businesses must obtain a Data Controller and/or Data Processor license, renewed every two years.
While SAs manage enforcement at a national level, within companies, the Data Protection Officer (DPO) is responsible for ensuring data protection laws are followed. In small startups, the DPO could be the Head of Legal or Head of Security. What’s important is that someone is responsible for data protection from the start, until an expert can be hired or the necessary skills can be developed in-house.
 			Data regulators in Africa 		
A privacy policy will help your company comply with data protection laws
Another way startups can comply with data protection laws is by having a privacy policy. This policy explains how the company collects, stores, shares, uses, and deletes personal data, along with the security measures used to protect it.
Any startup that collects personal data from employees, customers, or others must have a privacy policy. Data protection laws require companies to display a clear and easily accessible privacy policy wherever personal data is collected or processed.
A privacy policy is a startup’s obligation to customers and policies must be easy for individuals (or data subjects) to understand. For example, if you’re selling goods to French citizens in France, your privacy policy should be written in French.
Having a privacy policy can also help if a customer or merchant raises a complaint about how your business handles data. You may be able to refer to the terms in your privacy policy to reduce liability.
Shareable Takeaway
A privacy policy outlines how a company collects, stores, shares, and protects personal data.
 					Share on WhatsApp 				 					Share on Facebook 				 					Share on Twitter 				
What to include in your privacy policy
There’s no single way to create a privacy policy, but these essential elements can help you get started.
Consent of the data subject: Your privacy policy must explain how you obtain consent from users to collect and use their data. Consent means giving users a real choice about sharing their information. For example, if users can’t access your services without providing data, you’ll need another lawful reason to process it. If there’s no choice, it’s not genuine consent.
Effective date of the policy: Always include the date your privacy policy takes effect and note any updates. This shows users how up-to-date your privacy practices are and demonstrates your commitment to keeping their data safe.
Company information: The privacy policy should clearly outline what your company does and who the policy applies to (e.g., employees, vendors, website visitors). Include contact details for your Data Protection Officer (DPO) or privacy team, so users can easily reach out with concerns or questions.
What information is collected and how: You need to be specific about the types of data you collect and how you collect it. This includes personal details, cookies, and any other data collected through the company’s website or app.
Lawful basis for processing personal data: Every data collection must have a legal basis, whether it’s consent, fulfilling a contract, legal obligation, public or individual’s interest, or legitimate business interests. Your policy should outline which applies to each data type.
How the data will be used: Explain precisely how you plan to use the data. Are you using it to improve services, personalize experiences, or send marketing emails? Be clear, so users know why their data is being collected and how it benefits them.
Who receives the data: Be transparent about who you share data with and where. This could include service providers, government authorities, or law enforcement. If your business sells data (although this is often illegal), make sure it’s disclosed in the policy.
User rights: Your policy should list the rights users have under data protection laws, such as the right to access, correct, or delete their data, and explain how they can exercise these rights.
Data security and retention: The privacy policy should outline how the data will be protected, including security measures like encryption and access controls, as well as how long the data will be retained.
Policy updates: Data practices change over time. Ensure your privacy policy is updated whenever there are changes in how data is collected, used, or shared. Staying current helps maintain user trust and regulatory compliance.
Build trust from day one with strong data protection
No matter how early you are in your startup journey, it’s never too soon to prioritize data privacy and protection. Setting up a solid data protection program early helps you avoid potential risks and strengthens customer and partner trust. These early investments will pay off as your startup scales.

How to use Paystack Transfers
Common questions
At Paystack, we’re committed to simplifying how businesses manage payments. As a Paystack merchant in Kenya, you already accept payments via M-PESA, cards, and Apple Pay. Today, we’re excited to introduce you to Paystack Transfers.
Paystack Transfers allows you to send money as easily as you receive it. You can now transfer funds to any Kenyan bank account, M-PESA wallet, Paybill, or Till account, all from the same familiar Paystack Dashboard where you manage your transactions.
Why transfer money with Paystack?
We’ve worked closely with businesses across Kenya to understand their money transfer needs. The result is a simple, reliable, and customizable solution that solves many of the issues businesses face. Here’s how Paystack Transfers can streamline your payment workflows:
Say goodbye to juggling multiple platforms: Whether you're paying suppliers, reimbursing customers, or processing payroll, using Transfers on Paystack saves time and prevents errors because you can send money from the same platform where you accept payments.
Build custom transfer experiences via API: No matter how particular or complex your business needs are, the Paystack Transfers API allows you to easily build a solution that gives you fine-grained control over how you send money. For example, you can set up webhooks that update you on whether a transfer was successful. You can also set up an automation to fetch your Balance before initiating a transfer request using the Check BalanceAPI endpoint. Learn more about using Paystack’s API to create custom experiences.
Reduce errors and save time with bulk transfers: Instead of sending different sums to different recipients one at a time, simply upload a spreadsheet of your recipients’ bank details and click Send.
Control who can make transfers from your Paystack account: You can use our granular permissions system to secure your account. This means that while multiple members of your team can have access to your Paystack account to support their work, only you and key members of your team that you select can send money out from your account.

Let’s talk Developer Relations and developer experience in Africa
Developer experience is the sum of all interactions a developer has with a product, including APIs, SDKs, documentation, content, and community. A good developer experience empowers software engineers, making them feel productive and satisfied throughout their journey with your product.
Paystack’s developer experience is managed by our Developer Relations team. We support software engineers in building custom payment experiences as quickly and efficiently as possible.
We’re always looking to improve how well Paystack works for developers. As part of this effort, we recently conducted a user research exercise, engaging over 200 developers across Nigeria, Ghana, South Africa, and Kenya to better understand their needs.
While we learned a lot about how Paystack can better serve developers, we also discovered broader and surprising takeaways about the challenges African developers are facing.
We hope our findings will be useful to anyone running a similar research process or building technical tools for developers in Africa.
Whether you’re a business aiming to enhance your developer experience or a developer curious about your peers’ experiences, we hope you find this article insightful.
Shareable Takeaway
Developer experience is the sum of all interactions a developer has with a product, which, when positive, boosts their productivity and satisfaction.
 					Share on WhatsApp 				 					Share on Facebook 				 					Share on Twitter 				
Gathering developer insights
We used two methods for this research exercise: one-on-one interviews and a survey.
First, we conducted 15 interviews with developers, exploring various topics, including the types of content they consume, how engineering decisions are made in their organizations, and which developer communities they typically engage with. For those familiar with Paystack, we aimed to understand how they interacted with our tools and what improvements they’d like to see.
Next, we shared a survey with subscribers of our developer newsletter, receiving 194 responses from Nigeria, Kenya, Ghana, and South Africa.
The survey contained more detailed questions than those asked during the interviews, allowing us to analyze the demographic breakdown of our developer community and gather even more in-depth feedback on their experiences with Paystack’s developer tools.
Here are a few takeaways from our research:
Senior African developers are hungry for more advanced technical content
Senior developers shared that they struggle to find technical content on complex topics. While there is plenty of beginner content for junior developers, those with over four years of experience noted that many tutorials, blog posts, and panels are geared toward less advanced topics.
Informal conversations with developers and engineering organizations indicate that Africa’s tech ecosystem has a high proportion of junior developers. Our survey results support this: 46% of respondents had 0-3 years of experience, compared to 25% with 3-5 years, and 26% with over 5 years.

 			Years of experience in software development 		
As a result, content is often geared toward simpler, entry-level information, creating a gap for experienced developers seeking to advance their skills.
This presents a significant opportunity to serve senior developers with advanced technical content that meets their needs.
Engineering leaders in Africa are struggling to recruit senior talent
Another theme that emerged from our research is the challenge of finding experienced developers locally. Leaders of engineering teams shared that, due to the large pool of junior developers, most applicants for their open positions lack the level of experience required.
This situation presents a catch-22 for the local developer ecosystem: junior developers need jobs to gain experience, but many available positions require experience they haven’t yet acquired.
This highlights the need to find new ways to help junior developers build the skills and experience necessary to grow into the senior talent our ecosystem needs to thrive.

African developers are seeking community
Community is important in the personal and professional growth of software engineers. Being part of active developer communities accelerates skill development by enabling knowledge-sharing among peers. However, we found that many developers are missing out on these benefits.
54% of our respondents noted that they aren’t active in any developer groups but would like to be part of one. This indicates either a lack of sufficient communities for developers to join or that existing communities are not visible enough for developers to find.
We also found that community needs vary depending on a developer’s career stage and role. More senior engineers cited groups of peers, coworkers, and mentors as their primary form of community. These communities mainly serve as spaces to vet potential service providers, discuss investors, and share experiences.
Junior developers, on the other hand, prefer large conferences and panels where they can meet like-minded individuals, learn from talks, and visit sponsor booths for cool merch and hiring opportunities.
 			Membership within developer communities 		
What developers think about Paystack's developer experience
Our research explored developers’ experiences with Paystack tools and resources, as well as their feedback on the overall developer experience.
We were glad to hear how frequently developers shared that they really liked Paystack’s Developer Documentation. They appreciated seeing several code snippets for both basic integrations and advanced use cases. The clear, comprehensive documentation allows developers to integrate much more quickly than they expected, without needing to follow up frequently with our support team.
However, they also provided constructive feedback on how we could improve the developer experience. Some developers were unaware of many resources available, such as the Paystack CLI and official SDKs, while others needed better documentation to understand how to maximize the use of those tools.
Others shared that, while Paystack’s Developer Documentation did a great job covering payment flows (e.g., how to collect a transaction), the documentation could be improved for post-payment flows, such as API-driven ways to handle disputes and refunds. Finally, developers in South Africa, Kenya, and Ghana wanted Paystack to play a much more visible and active role in their local developer ecosystems.
 			Familiarity with Paystack's developer resources 		
This feedback helped us understand how to approach developer experience across multiple markets, as well as identify the gaps we need to fill to better support developers in their integration journey.
Using developer personas to improve developer experience
To translate our research into actionable strategies, we created three developer personas. These are archetypes of the broad categories of developers we encountered during our interviews and validated with survey data.
Each persona — The Learner, The Journeyman, and The Manager — has unique goals, challenges, and behaviors:
The Learner: An entry-level developer focused on upskilling and gaining recognition in the tech community. They need beginner-focused content, easy-to-follow documentation, and active communities for support and networking.
The Journeyman: A mid-level developer aiming to advance in their career, possibly toward engineering management or starting a company. They seek advanced technical content, growth-focused events, and opportunities to contribute to the developer community.
The Manager: A senior engineer, like a CTO or VP, focused on scaling technology, optimizing performance, and building strong teams. They are driven by high-level business objectives and the need to attract and retain top talent.
These personas serve as decision-making tools to guide our interactions with developers. For example, we use them to plan content and inform our event strategies, ensuring we meet the varied needs of each archetype.
In June, we partnered with AWS to host a CTO Roundtable in Lagos, Nigeria, using the Manager persona to shape the event’s structure and content. We brought CTOs, VPs, and other technical leaders together for a highly tactical discussion about how to scale AWS use while keeping costs low.
 			CTOs and VPs at Paystack's CTO Roundtable in June 2024 		
The personas aren’t static; as our product evolves and we engage with more developers, we may discover new personas or need to update existing ones. The key is to keep engaging with our developers and refining these profiles over time.
Evaluating developer experience with the Developer Journey Map
A concept that really helped us while working on this project was the idea of the Developer Journey Map.
This is a simple visualization of the stages that a developer goes through to find success with a developer tool: from Discovery, to Evaluation, to Learning, to Building, and finally, to Scaling.
The Journey Map was created by James Parton and Caroline Lewko and is mentioned in Developer Relations: How to Build and Grow a Successful Developer Relations Program, a resource we’ve found invaluable.
 			The Developer Journey Map by James Parton and Caroline Lewko 		
Imagining ourselves as each of the three personas, we mapped the potential journey each could take through these five stages. At each stage, we examined our existing resources, identified gaps, and assessed how well our developer touchpoints were working.
If you’re looking to improve your own developer experience, I strongly encourage you to assess your processes against the Developer Journey Map. It’s a simple but powerful way to identify potential points of friction and opportunities for improvement.
Key areas we’re focused on to further improve the Paystack developer experience
Our research helped us understand meaningful ways we could better support developers looking to integrate Paystack. But insights are just the beginning — the exciting part is putting these learnings into action.
Here are some key areas we’re focusing on:
Upgrading our developer tools
We’ve already kickstarted this by updating our official Node.js and Python libraries and releasing new SDKs for Android and iOS development.
Alongside these updates, we are creating more comprehensive help content and tutorials to guide developers in using these tools effectively.
Engaging more with developer communities in expansion markets
We’re actively seeking more opportunities to engage with developers in markets like Côte d’Ivoire, Ghana, Kenya, and South Africa. This includes participating in local tech events, partnering with developer communities to host meetups, and creating region-specific content that addresses the unique needs and challenges of each market.
This year, we’ve already initiated some of these efforts by hosting developer meetups in Accra, Lagos, and Nairobi. We also sponsored DevConf ZA, South Africa’s largest community-run conference for software developers, and we’re proud sponsors of this year’s GirlCode ZA annual hackathon for women and girls in tech in South Africa.
 			Paystack at DevConf ZA in South Africa 		
Further improvements to the Paystack Developer Documentation
It’s really important to us that the Paystack Developer Documentation is the best it can be. We’re always trying to find ways to improve and ensure that developers using our APIs have all the information and resources they need to build with Paystack.
Making sure our docs are comprehensive and easy to follow means a lot to us. From refining our documentation process to improving the platform that hosts our docs, we’re constantly looking for ways to enhance the experience for developers working with our APIs.
Recently, we expanded our content with updates to our Transfers and Bulk Charge documentation. We also introduced a new Developer Tools section to house documentation on tools like the new Android and iOS SDKs and Inline JS v2. Additionally, our API reference now includes several of the most common API errors that developers encounter, along with guidance on how to resolve them.
Currently, we’re focused on further improving our Developer Documentation to make information even easier to find and understand. This includes reorganizing our content structure, adding more code examples, clearly linking to available developer tools and resources, and creating more intuitive navigation paths for developers at different stages of their journey.
In the longer term, we’re working on a complete OpenAPI spec for the Paystack API. This will enable several exciting improvements. We’ll be able to automate the generation of API references, ensuring that the documentation perfectly reflects what’s on the production API. The OpenAPI spec file will also allow us to quickly generate other tools and resources, like SDKs and Postman Collections. All of these improvements will help developers integrate with Paystack more quickly and without issues.
Let’s talk Developer Relations and developer experience in Africa
While these are our key focus areas right now, they are not all we’ll do. This research exercise wasn’t a one-off event, and we expect that as we talk to more developers, their feedback will continue to shape our roadmap.
Our goal is to create a developer experience that not only meets current needs but also anticipates future ones. We’re excited about the road ahead and look forward to growing and evolving alongside our developer community.
We hope this article has helped illuminate how we think about developer experience at Paystack. We also hope that our research methodology and results provided some guidance on how to engage technical users at your startup.

Building the Angular Paystack Library
How Ekene Ashinze built a key open source library for Angular developers
Tolulope Kalejaiye
Customer Success Manager, Developer Relations, 					Paystack
On this page
The Developer Contributor Spotlight program highlights software engineers who use Paystack’s APIs to create tools and resources that benefit others. One such developer is Ekene Ashinze, a Software Engineer at Microsoft and the creator of the Angular Paystack Library, a module that enables developers to accept payments in their Angular apps using Paystack.
In this interview, Ekene shares his journey in open source development, the challenges he faced, and the impact it has had on his career.
To start, could you introduce yourself to our readers? Please share your name, where you're based, what you do professionally, and one interesting fact about yourself.
I'm Ekene Ashinze, and I'm a software engineer at Microsoft. I've been with the company for about four years, initially working in the Nigeria office before relocating to Vancouver, Canada. Currently, I work on the Microsoft Copilot app, focusing on the frontend experience. This involves handling data retrieval from AI models and rendering it, as well as managing authentication for enterprise users.
As for an interesting fact, I recently went skydiving for the first time. It was an exhilarating experience, and I'm already planning to do it again!
 			Ekene’s first skydiving experience was in Vancouver, Canada. 		
That's quite an adventurous spirit! Speaking of taking leaps, let's discuss your open source contribution. Can you describe the library you've developed and what inspired you to create it?
A few years ago, when I was deeply involved in the open source space, I noticed Paystack had libraries for popular frontend frameworks like React and Vue. There was even a library for Angular v1, but nothing for Angular v2 and onwards. I saw this as an opportunity to fill a gap and decided to build the Angular Paystack library.
This was actually my first significant open source project. Prior to this, I had contributed to other open source projects and had created a small package for randomizing arrays, but the Angular Paystack library was my first major undertaking.
Taking on such a project, especially with a framework known for its complexity, must have been challenging. What was the most difficult aspect of developing this library, and how did you overcome it?
Angular is known for having a steep learning curve compared to other frontend frameworks. The most challenging aspect for me was understanding dependency injection. It was difficult to grasp at first, but I knew it was crucial for making the library easier to implement for users.
To overcome this, I had to dive deep into the Angular documentation, reading about services, NgModules, providers, injections, injection tokens, and related concepts. I also found content from Netanel Basel and Todd Motto really helpful.
It was challenging, but it also became a significant learning opportunity. By building the library, I gained a much deeper understanding of Angular's core concepts.
Shareable Takeaway
The Angular Paystack library allows developers to integrate payments into their Angular apps using Paystack.
 					Share on WhatsApp 				 					Share on Facebook 				 					Share on Twitter 				
It sounds like you had to push through some tough concepts. Was there a moment during this process that felt particularly rewarding or exciting?
Absolutely! The most rewarding moment was when I finally understood how NgModules worked in the context of building a library. I had a basic understanding before, but creating a module that others could use and figuring out how to use injection tokens to allow users to pass in their public key was a real 'aha' moment for me. When it all came together and worked as intended, it was incredibly satisfying.
That must have been a great feeling! But of course, the work doesn't stop once the library is built. Open source maintenance requires ongoing commitment. How do you manage to balance maintaining your contribution with your other responsibilities?
You're right, maintenance is crucial. Angular has a six-month release schedule for major versions, which helps me structure my maintenance work. Whenever a new Angular version is released, I block out a weekend to update the library and ensure it's compatible with the latest version. This way, users can always rely on the library to work with the most recent Angular release.

Beyond the technical aspects, how has working on this library impacted your personal and professional growth?
The impact has been significant. Open source contributions have been instrumental in my growth, both personally and professionally. For instance, I was offered an interview with Paystack, likely because of this library. Even though I didn’t end up taking the position, it opened doors for me. I even interviewed for a role at another company, and found out that they were using the Angular Paystack library!
Open source work is especially valuable for those just starting out who may not have extensive company experience. Your GitHub profile becomes a showcase of your skills and what you can offer to potential employers. It's a great way to gain industry-standard experience, learn from experts, and build a portfolio that speaks for itself.
How has the wider open source community responded to your library? Have you had any memorable interactions or feedback?
The response has been overwhelmingly positive and sometimes surprising! I remember walking on campus once when someone shouted ‘Angular!’ to get my attention. We had never met before, but they recognized me from my work on the library. At conferences and community events, people often approach me to say they’re using the library and how helpful it’s been.
I’ve received emails from companies asking questions about implementing the library and even job offers as a result of my work. It’s incredibly fulfilling to know that something I created is being used by hundreds of people every week and is having a real impact.
For someone reading this interview who might be wondering why they should contribute to open source, what motivation would you give them?
Open source is a great way to break the 'experience catch-22' where companies want experience, but you need a job to get experience. With open source, you don't need prior experience to start contributing, and those contributions serve as valuable experience you can take anywhere.
You learn by reading code written by experienced developers, having your code reviewed, and collaborating with others. It's an incredible learning opportunity. Your GitHub profile becomes your resume, portfolio, and personal website all in one. Open source can be really instrumental at the start of one’s career, so I encourage anyone looking to gain experience to start contributing to open source projects.
Shareable Takeaway
Contributing to open source projects is a great way for developers to get real-world experience. It’s a hands-on way to learn, and it also helps build a portfolio.
 					Share on WhatsApp 				 					Share on Facebook 				 					Share on Twitter 				
Looking at your own journey, do you have any plans to expand the functionality of your library, or perhaps create additional open source tools in the future?
For the Angular Paystack library, I believe it has reached a level of maturity where it serves its purpose well. Paystack has a platform-agnostic library that works across different frameworks, so there's less need to expand the Angular-specific library.
Editor’s note: Ekene has included a section in the Angular Paystack Library’s documentation that allows developers to add new features. To get started, check out the section labeled 'Contributing.’
Your contributions have clearly made an impact on the Paystack community, Ekene. Can you share where people can find and connect with you?
I’m on LinkedIn as Ekene Ashinze and on Twitter as @ashinzekene..
Thank you for sharing your journey with us and for your continued dedication to open source development. We look forward to seeing what you create next!

Signals to pay attention to in African fintech for the rest of 2024
How fintechs are navigating capital, regulation, and market shifts in 2024

Market Intelligence Specialist, 					Paystack
On this page
How fintechs are navigating the capital crunch
Inflation and currency depreciation driving changes in fintech supply chains
Increased adoption of non-card payment methods for merchant payments
Tricky regulatory and political climate ahead
Migration’s impact on talent, remittances, and fintech expansion strategy
Other themes and trends
Last year, we took a deep dive into African fintech in 2022, analyzing the key developments, recurring themes, and emerging trends that we anticipated would play a key role in the new year. This time, as we move further along into 2024, our focus shifts to the future as we embark on what’s shaping up to be an equally compelling year for fintech on the continent. In true Decode Fintech style, we’ll be exploring what’s working, what’s not, and where fintech in Africa is going next.
How fintechs are navigating the capital crunch
The last two years have posed significant challenges for venture capital (VC) investments into African startups, continuing a trend we highlighted in our 2022 African fintech review. Last year, the value of VC investments into African fintechs declined by 41% compared to the previous year. According to Briter Bridges, total funding to African tech startups hit $2.9 billion in 2023, a 39% decline from 2022. 
Despite this decline, some African fintechs have shown remarkable resilience, continuing to make critical changes to ensure the survival of their business in an uncertain funding environment.
List of notable VC equity rounds by African fintechs in 2023
Some fintechs like Zazuu and Lazerpay faced the tough decision to close their doors due to a lack of funding, while others explored options such as hiring freezes, salary cuts, layoffs, pivots, pricing increases, and shuttered product lines.
For fintechs that ceased operations for other reasons, financial constraints often revealed underlying issues like mismanagement or flawed business models. Fintechs currently struggling to generate sufficient revenue for their operations or growth are seeing their respective runways fast approaching critical levels. With external funding still scarce or internal cash flow negative, many fintechs will have to explore even more severe changes to ensure their survival.
Notable African fintech shutdowns in 2023
In addition to pursuing mergers and acquisitions, which offer interesting benefits like expanded customer bases, enhanced technological capabilities, and improved market positioning, African fintechs are increasingly turning to debt funding as a viable alternative.
Debt financing can provide the necessary capital without diluting ownership, making it an attractive option for fintechs looking to maintain control while securing funds. However, it’s important to note that the lion’s share of this debt capital has been channeled towards digital banking and lending startups, as these segments often present business models and cash flow profiles best suited for debt financing.

It will be interesting to see how African fintechs navigate and innovate within these constraints to not only survive but potentially get ahead. While constraints limit options, they can also serve as a catalyst for businesses to think more creatively. Despite the anticipated challenges, there’s a promising outlook for those fintechs ready to seize this period as an opportunity to reinvent their strategies and emerge stronger.

Inflation and currency depreciation driving changes in fintech supply chains
African fintechs continue to grapple with the dual challenges of consumer inflation and local currency depreciation across key markets, including Nigeria, Kenya, and Egypt. In 2023, these currencies weakened significantly, a shift that, coupled with surging food and energy costs, has affected vital fintech metrics like consumer spending and loan repayment rates.
While countries like Kenya and Egypt saw some currency appreciation earlier in the year, underlying macroeconomic weaknesses will affect long-term recovery. Nigeria, which has seen oil revenues and foreign investments falter, has removed subsidies for fuel, power, and foreign currency. Removing these subsidies affects consumer purchasing power and is forcing businesses to rethink existing models of consumer spending in one of Africa’s biggest economies.
Inflation rates in December 2023
African fintechs are deeply interconnected with the global market, relying on a mix of imported resources like capital, cloud services, card chips, and POS terminals, as well as globally priced costs like expert talent and transaction fees. In an ideal scenario, fintechs would balance their scales by either marking up local prices or scaling their operations to ensure that their local earnings keep pace with the mounting global expenses and inflationary pressures.
However, as we highlighted in previous editions of our newsletter, regulatory frameworks and competitive forces particularly constrain the pricing of financial products, significantly limiting the extent to which financial institutions can revise customer charges.
We anticipate that fintechs will tweak their approach by starting to charge for services that used to be free or offered at minimal cost, while also localizing costs to match revenue. This means they’ll be looking more at getting funded in local currency by getting listed on local stock exchanges or taking out local loans. This also means leaning towards working with local suppliers and tech partners for key services and rethinking hiring overseas talent.
When local alternatives fall short in availability or reliability, we’re bound to see some disruption to product offerings that rely on those crucial inputs. For example, the surge in POS terminal costs – discussed in Issue 182 of the Decode Fintech newsletter – has pushed agency banking providers in Nigeria to either scale back, pivot into merchant acquiring, or offer non-card options to agents.
The key question is determining which business models and supply chains will adapt and how they’ll navigate the ongoing impact of these macroeconomic shifts.

Increased adoption of non-card payment methods for merchant payments
African consumers have long favored mobile money and bank transfers for peer-to-peer payments, while cards have been the go-to for commerce. But we’re now seeing more innovations that make wallets and bank accounts work better for merchant payments.
In 2022, card payments made up 54% of non-recurring transactions processed across all Paystack markets. In 2023, the percentage gradually dropped to 25% by December, with bank transfers and mobile money taking over the bulk of the transaction volume by year's end.

As we’ve noted before, the high cost of card processing fees and the expense of importing payment terminals and smart chips have pushed merchants and financial service providers toward more affordable, locally priced payment options. Additionally, consumers have shown a strong preference for affordable, familiar, and mobile-friendly payment methods, accelerating the shift away from card payments.
With growing interest in open banking and new developments like the introduction of consumer direct debit in Nigeria and standing orders by M-PESA, we expect these alternatives to surpass card payment experiences in 2024.
Tricky regulatory and political climate ahead
While some regional alliances and objectives exist, fintech regulation across Africa remains highly fragmented. Financial regulators in different countries are advancing at varying speeds and sometimes in conflicting directions. Given the challenges facing fintechs, the role of regulators as arbiters of compliance, protectors of consumer interests, and enablers of ecosystem growth has never been more critical.
A notable example of clear policymaking clashing with confusing enforcement is seen in Nigeria, where the Central Bank of Nigeria (CBN), following a personnel restructuring, released new guidelines for financial institutions regarding interactions with cryptocurrency companies. However, despite these regulations, Nigerian authorities have been cracking down on crypto firms accused of currency manipulation and other illegal activities.
The CBN has been active beyond the cryptocurrency space, introducing new regulations covering agency banking, contactless payments, and open banking. Similarly, other African countries have released updated guidelines, such as virtual assets in Namibia, and mobile money in Ethiopia.
Zooming out, African fintechs should also keep a keen eye on new policymaking directions driven by changing economic and political situations across the continent. In addition to inflation and currency depreciation, key African fintech markets like Nigeria, Egypt, and Kenya are grappling with mounting debt. Countries like South Africa have also recently changed leadership, and Ghana, by way of its elections, will be doing so in December.
We’ve already seen how an aggressive drive for tax revenue and new economic policies can affect fintech fortunes. In Nigeria, the CBN’s policies on new banknotes and cash withdrawals at the beginning of 2023 drove more Nigerians towards digital payments. The newly elected Nigerian government also removed fuel and foreign exchange subsidies which affected business and consumer spending. Over in the east, Kenya’s increased tax oversight on mobile money transactions has reportedly driven more Kenyan SMEs to prefer cash payments.
Ultimately, African fintechs must contend not just with dwindling cash reserves but also with emergent and uncertain policies that affect their businesses in new and unpredictable ways.

Migration’s impact on talent, remittances, and fintech expansion strategy
African technology workers are on the move. Explosive population growth, tightening economic conditions, and rising political instability are among the factors driving an exodus of African talent seeking better opportunities in developed, high-income countries.
Some of this migration is within the continent to emerging tech hubs like Kigali and Nairobi but most of these technology and business workers are setting their sights outside the continent, intending to earn globally competitive salaries from large tech companies or well-funded startups. Countries like the United Kingdom and Canada have spun up residence programs to take advantage of this shift.
Until Artificial Intelligence takes all our jobs, fintech products will still need to be built by people. There is little public data, but informal conversations with founders reveal that employee attrition from fintechs is already affecting key processes, including recruitment, product delivery, and partnership discussions. Facing fundraising and revenue challenges, many fintechs are losing leverage in hiring and retainment discussions and might struggle to acquire and retain experienced local talent as these limiting conditions persist.
The implications of brain drain for fintechs are not just disruption to business operations, but a dip in product experience for customers and a loss of critical context needed to avoid old mistakes and navigate a growing ecosystem.
That said, some fintechs are taking advantage of these migratory shifts. One positive effect of African migration has been growing foreign remittances into Africa from foreign workers. According to the World Bank, $53 billion in foreign remittances flowed into African countries in 2023 through formal channels.
Most remittances into the continent are either through costly legacy players or informal channels. Fintechs like LemFi, NALA, and Flutterwave’s Send have emerged or evolved to provide faster, cheaper, and more seamless remittance experiences for Africans.
Average remittance costs by region: cash vs digital services
Beyond just giving fintechs access to needed foreign currency liquidity, consumer remittances are also a first step towards a bigger expansion strategy. Modern financial plumbing that enables cross-border trade and money movement for entire economies and businesses will likely start with smaller pipes built for people to move money within and outside the continent.
As fintechs continue to face challenges within their operating environment, there might be solutions that exist outside of those borders.
But even if fintechs capture the financial opportunities, the tech talent issue remains a challenge. Startups dedicated to training tech talent have emerged, such as AltSchool Africa, ALX, and TalentQL, exploring internship and graduate trainee programs to broaden their talent pipelines.
However, the challenge isn’t just about hiring; it’s about retention. While a slowdown in the global tech job market has temporarily eased pressures for African startups, the long-term trend shows experienced professionals still seeking opportunities abroad.
Startups need to adapt by anticipating shorter employee tenures and overhauling their cultural and operational systems. This means expanding hiring pools for junior talent, investing in thorough documentation, standardizing employee development processes, and perhaps most importantly, creating a great work culture and environment for local talent.
Ultimately, it would be a significant setback if the innovation and ambition of African fintech were stifled by a lack of experienced and motivated professionals willing to commit to the mission. Any investment made towards retaining talent would be well worth it.

Other themes and trends
Beyond the major themes above, several other notable trends are likely to shape the remainder of 2024.
Payment fraud
Payment fraud remains a significant challenge for both fintech operators and regulators. Despite advances in digital identity verification, losses due to fraud persist. The explosive adoption of mobile wallets and agent networks has also made these channels attractive targets for fraudulent activities. 
According to NIBSS (Nigeria Inter-Bank Settlement System), digital payment fraud losses increased by 23% to NGN 17.7 billion in 2023, with mobile and point-of-sale (POS) channels recording the highest losses.
Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning
Large Language Models (LLMs) have gained significant traction globally. African fintechs already use machine learning for identity verification, fraud detection, and loan underwriting. We expect these new AI Advancements to enhance products and back-office operations like support and compliance.
Crypto adoption
Interest in crypto is growing, particularly with the adoption of stablecoins and layer-2 blockchains for identity and other applications. African fintechs increasingly use crypto solutions for cross-border payments. While regulatory bottlenecks exist in markets like Nigeria, South Africa has introduced new licenses and regulations that may drive adoption.
Digital transformation
The transformation of payment and banking processes continues across both formal institutions and informal businesses. At Paystack, we’ve observed merchants in consumer goods, logistics, and even oil and gas shifting toward electronic payments. For instance, Chowdeck, a leading logistics and food delivery company in Nigeria, processed almost N2.5 billion in monthly volume without offering payment on delivery. Cab drivers and traders are increasingly comfortable accepting bank and mobile money transfers. We expect this shift to continue across markets as the year progresses.
As the year progresses and African fintechs navigate the evolving landscape, they'll need to continue adapting to the challenges posed by some of the trends mentioned above. However, despite hurdles like economic uncertainties and the ongoing talent migration, fintech on the continent remains a hotbed of innovation, poised to push economic growth and financial inclusion across the continent. 
The rest of the year will be crucial for fintechs to reassess their strategies, embrace resilience, and seize the opportunities presented by the rapidly evolving ecosystem. 
And as always, Decode Fintech will continue to be your trusted guide in the African fintech landscape through our long-form commentary.

Common questions
Do you have any questions?
In 2023, we introduced Virtual Terminal in Nigeria, enabling businesses to accept in-person payments swiftly and at scale, with ZERO hardware costs. Today, we’re excited to announce that Virtual Terminal is now available to Paystack merchants in Côte d’Ivoire, Ghana, Kenya, and South Africa.
Shareable Takeaway
Paystack Virtual Terminal helps businesses accept secure, in-person payments with real-time confirmations and ZERO hardware costs.

What is Paystack Virtual Terminal?
Paystack Virtual Terminal is a simple, hardware-free solution for businesses that accept in-person payments, such as retail stores, restaurants, or pay-on-delivery services. It streamlines your payment processes by integrating Paystack’s seamless online checkout experience directly into your physical location, complete with real-time payment notifications to alert you about transactions.
With Paystack Virtual Terminal, you can generate unique QR codes for any customer-facing staff, such as cashiers, delivery riders, or sales agents. When a customer scans the QR code, they can choose to pay via any of Paystack's multiple payment channels—Mobile Money, Cards, Apple Pay, and more. 
After the successful payment, the staff member gets an instant confirmation via WhatsApp, and the customer can be on their way.
Virtual Terminal is optimized for the most popular payment channel in your country
With a single QR code, Virtual Terminal offers customers in each country a variety of payment methods optimized for that region.
Côte d’Ivoire
Available payment methods: MTN MoMo, Wave, Orange Money, Visa, Mastercard, and Apple Pay.
Ghana
Available payment methods: MTN MoMo, Telecel Cash (previously Vodafone Cash), AirtelTigo Money, Visa, Mastercard, and Apple Pay.
Kenya

South Africa
Available payment methods: Scan to Pay, SnapScan, EFT, Visa, Mastercard, American Express, and Apple Pay.
Why businesses love Paystack Virtual Terminal
Scale in-store payments across multiple staff and locations, in seconds
Virtual Terminal dramatically simplifies your business operations. Whether your business operates with a single sales agent or spans a network of 1,000 across multiple stores in various cities, Virtual Terminal is incredibly easy to scale geographically. 
You simply create as many QR codes as you need and assign them to your sales agents, all from your Paystack Dashboard. This eliminates the operational burden of managing multiple physical POS devices, while significantly cutting your costs. 
Allow sales agents to confirm payments, without seeing bank balances
 			Sales agents receive WhatsApp notifications when payment is successful 		
When you assign virtual QR codes to your sales agents, they receive WhatsApp notifications for successful payments. The 'successful payment' alert with the amount received is the only thing that the agent sees: the notification does not contain any additional information, such as the total amount of money your business has received. Only you, the administrator of the business, can access that information via the Paystack Dashboard.
Additionally, you can disable a Virtual Terminal QR code at any time, change the WhatsApp number tied to it, and also set it up so that multiple WhatsApp numbers receive an alert when a payment is made.
Give your customers a wide range of in-person payment options
Each Virtual Terminal account comes with a beautiful, autogenerated poster that you can print from the Paystack Dashboard and prominently display to inform customers about the wide range of payment methods available to them. 
Some businesses choose to display this poster as a table tent, while others create a smart-looking lanyard that staff can easily carry around.
However your customers prefer to pay, you’ll be able to accept that payment seamlessly, and all Virtual Terminal payments are ultimately deposited into your preferred payout bank account. 
Here’s how to download your Virtual Terminal posters →
All the other benefits that come with accepting payments with Paystack
Virtual Terminal comes with all the other benefits of the Paystack ecosystem of products:
International payments: With Virtual Terminal, your international customers can reliably scan to pay with their foreign-issued cards or Apple Pay.
Split payments: If you run a company that has several lines of business, Virtual Terminal allows you to receive one payment and automatically split different amounts into separate business bank accounts.
Easy end-of-day accounting: If you run multiple stores and also accept payments online, you can get instant visibility into all your transactions — online and offline — on your Paystack Dashboard for reconciliation. You also get useful, granular data on each sale made via each Terminal, so that you can instantly identify your best sales reps, and most profitable stores.
Track all payments from your phone: You can easily monitor all your payments from the Paystack Merchant App (iOS and Android). Download the app to get started!
and so much more!

Introducing Transfers to bank accounts in Ghana
Send single and bulk transfers to Ghanaian bank accounts from your Paystack Dashboard and via API
Kwadwo Owusu-Agyeman
Country Lead, 					Paystack

Why transfer money with Paystack?
How are businesses using Paystack Transfers?
How to use Paystack Transfers
Common questions
We’re excited to announce Transfers to bank accounts in Ghana. Paystack already allows businesses to make single or bulk disbursements (Transfers) to any Ghanaian mobile money wallet. With this update, you can now also transfer money with Paystack to any Ghanaian bank account!
Why transfer money with Paystack?
Using Transfers on Paystack saves time because you can send money from the same platform where you accept payments. Here are some other reasons to send money with Paystack:
Send money to multiple bank accounts at once: Reduce errors and save time by sending money to multiple bank accounts at once. Instead of sending different sums to different recipients one at a time, you can simply upload a spreadsheet of your recipients’ bank details and click send.
Verify your customers’ bank account details: Our Resolve Account Number service ensures that you can verify the bank account details of your recipient, minimizing the risk of sending money to the wrong recipient. Another reason to validate the identity of the owner of a bank account is to avoid making transfers to fraudsters who might impersonate your recipients by swapping out their bank details for their own. Learn more about our Resolve Account Number service here.
Build custom transfer experiences via API: No matter how complex or unique your business needs are, the Paystack Transfers API allows you to easily build a solution that gives you fine-grained control over how you send money. For example, you can set up webhooks that update you on whether a transfer was successful. You can also set up an automation to fetch your Paystack Balance before initiating a transfer request using the Check BalanceAPI endpoint. Learn more about using Paystack’s API to create custom experiences here.
Control who can make transfers from your Paystack account: This means that while multiple team members can access your Paystack Dashboard to support their work, only you and the specific team members you select can send money out from your Balance.
How are businesses using Paystack Transfers?
Businesses with different needs and levels of operational complexity use Paystack in various ways. Here are some examples:
Tech startups can use the Transfers API to build beautiful, seamless experiences for their customers. For example, lending, investment, or savings fintechs can build elegant payout flows that send money to customers quickly and with minimal manual input.
Businesses can quickly pay their vendors for products or services, using Paystack Transfers right from their Dashboards.
Businesses can use the bulk transfer option from the dashboard or API to pay their staff salaries, all at once.
How to use Paystack Transfers
To use the Transfers feature, you need to be a Registered Paystack Business. Once you’re registered, the next step is to make sure you have money in your Paystack Balance. This can be done using our Topup feature, which allows you to move money from a mobile money wallet or debit card into your Paystack Balance. Click here to learn more about the Topup feature.
Alternatively, Ghanaian merchants can use our new Manual Payouts feature. This feature, created with our bank partners, gives you more control over the funds you receive from your customers.
With Manual Payouts, whenever you receive payments from your customers, Paystack will hold the funds in your Paystack Balance, instead of automatically settling the money into your bank account. Learn more about the Manual Payouts feature here.
Once your Paystack Balance is topped up, you can transfer money to bank accounts or mobile money wallets.

For more complex needs and to send money via the Paystack API, you can check out our developer documentation on Transfers →
Lastly, here’s a guide on how to use the Resolve Account Number API to validate the details of your recipients’ bank accounts before sending them money.
Common questions
Does Paystack charge for Transfers?
Paystack charges a small fee per successful transfer. Check out our current pricing here →
Is there a minimum and maximum amount that can be sent with Paystack?
The minimum amount you can transfer at a time is GHS 1, and the maximum amount is GHS 100,000.
Can merchants in Ghana transfer money to non-Ghanaian bank accounts?
Merchants in Ghana can only transfer money to Ghanaian bank accounts for now.
Can merchants in Ghana transfer money to more than one bank account at a time?
Yes, using our Bulk Transfers feature, you can add all the recipient bank accounts and corresponding amounts to a spreadsheet, upload it, and click send. If you’d like to send bulk money transfers from the Dashboard, check out this guide →
How long can I choose to keep my collected funds in my Paystack Balance?
Once you switch your Paystack account to the Manual Payouts option, you can keep funds received from your customers in your Paystack Balance for as long as you like, with the condition that you initiate at least one transfer within 90 days. 
If you don’t initiate a single transfer within that period, Paystack will automatically settle your funds to your designated settlement account. This is a regulatory requirement to ensure that funds are being used only for Transfers.
Learn more about the Manual Payouts feature here.
Can both Starter and Registered Businesses use Paystack Transfers?
Only Registered Businesses can use the Transfers feature for now. If you have a Starter Business, you can upgrade to a Registered Business account here →
With Paystack Transfers, you get more control and convenience for your business. If you have any more questions or need a hand getting started, kindly send us a message. We’re happy to help! 💙",blog

Getting started with Payouts on Demand
Common questions
We’re excited to introduce Payouts on Demand, which allows businesses in Nigeria to request instant payouts at any time, even on weekends and public holidays.
The default payout schedule for businesses remains one working day after payment collection (T+1), but for those times when you need the money more quickly, the new Payouts on Demand feature allows you access cash instantly.

Keep your operations running smoothly
Payouts on Demand helps you maintain steady cash flow to reinvest in your operations.
By default, Paystack merchants in Nigeria receive their payouts automatically within one business day. But some businesses have inventory or operational needs that require them to have access to cash as soon as possible. For example, an electricity vendor might need new electricity inventory, or an airline might need to purchase fuel to keep on schedule.
For such businesses, delayed access to funds might seriously harm their operations.
Payouts on Demand solves this by giving you access to up to 70% of your Paystack payout at any time. While the industry standard is to enable payouts on demand for only specific payment channels (eg. only on POS transactions), Paystack Payouts on Demand is enabled for payments collected across ALL payment channels, including card payments. This flexibility helps you keep operations running seamlessly and customers happy.
Getting started with Payouts on Demand
Payouts on Demand is available to all Paystack merchants in Nigeria who have received at least one payment per week, for four consecutive weeks.
If you’re eligible, you'll find the maximum amount available for you to pay out, and a 'Request Payout Now' button, on the homepage of your Paystack Dashboard.
Here are some key details to note about Payouts on Demand:
You can access up to 70% of your Payout Balance at the time of the request
You can request payouts as many times as you like in a day, with a minimum payout of NGN 1,000
We charge a fee of 1% for each requested payout

Common questions
How many times can I make a payout request in a day?
You can request payouts as often as you like, as long as the total requested payout is less than 70% of your Payout Balance at the time of the request. So if you’ve received NGN 1 million as of the time of request, for instance, you’ll be eligible to receive up to NGN 700k (70% of NGN 1 million).
Can I access Payouts on Demand via API?
You can currently only access Payouts on Demand from your Paystack Dashboard.
How long does it take to receive the money after making a payout request?
It's an instant process, and you'll receive the money within minutes of your request.
Can I request more than I have in my Payout Balance?
No, you can currently only request up to 70% of the amount customers have already paid you.
What types of businesses can access Payouts on Demand?
Payouts on Demand is only available to merchants in Nigeria on the Registered Business tier. If you’re on the Starter Business tier, you can learn how to upgrade to become a Registered business here →

Join the Paystack Direct Debit waitlist
We’re thrilled to announce early access to Paystack Direct Debit.
Developed in close partnership with the Nigeria Inter-Bank Settlement System (NIBSS), Paystack Direct Debit is a new, fully digital, and secure way for businesses to directly charge customers’ bank accounts in Nigeria.
Join the waitlist to get early access!
What is Paystack Direct Debit?
In conversation with merchants, we heard that businesses that collect frequent repeat payments from customers needed a way to access customers’ bank accounts directly, in a way that was convenient and secure. We built Direct Debit in response.
Shareable Takeaway
Paystack Direct Debit helps businesses that collect frequent repeat payments directly charge customers’ bank accounts. Join the waitlist!
 					Share on WhatsApp 				 					Share on Facebook 				 					Share on Twitter 				
Here’s how it works:
You request your customer to link their bank account to your business
To consent, the customer transfers a small amount of money to a NIBSS-provided bank account number
Once the bank transfer is confirmed, a mandate is created, linking the customer’s bank account to your business. This enables you to charge both one-time as well as recurring payments via Paystack, according to your shared agreement with the customer.
Direct Debit provides a powerful new way for businesses that collect frequent repeat payments from customers (eg. subscription services, insurance companies, and fintechs) to do so even more reliably.
We’re proud to have worked closely with NIBSS over the last several months to develop a fast, convenient, secure direct debit solution supported by 20+ banks in Nigeria.

Don’t overshare: A business owner’s guide to data privacy and security
Best practices for secure digital interactions
Toulu Akerele
Data Protection Officer, 					Paystack

Use official channels
Stick to the essentials - don't overshare
Your login details are just for you
Data protection is good business
Support your customers' data rights
Read our privacy policy
Craft your own privacy policy
Imagine you're leaving your home for a trip. You’d lock all your doors, and in some cases, even the windows. You wouldn’t want intruders to find an easy access point, especially in your absence. Your online world works the same way. Oversharing private information is like leaving your digital front door ajar—you might as well include a welcome note for thieves.
Oversharing happens a fair amount in business. In the rush to resolve issues, it's easy to overshare information, especially with customer success agents. However, it's critical to remember that not all information needs to be shared, even when you think it might speed up service.
Here are some tips to help you safeguard your digital home as you connect with customer service teams.
Use official channels
Connect with customer service agents only through official platforms. You can think of it like a secure handshake — by using official channels, you’re entering a protected space where each party can be sure of the other’s identity. This eliminates the risks associated with unauthorized access or fake platforms where sensitive information could be compromised. Plus, customer service teams like ours have put in extra security checks to confirm that we're actually speaking with you, ensuring that your information stays safe and secure.

Shareable Takeaway
Connect with customer service agents only via official channels to avoid the security risks of unofficial platforms that could endanger sensitive information.
 					Share on WhatsApp 				 					Share on Facebook 				 					Share on Twitter 				
Stick to the essentials - don't overshare
When it comes to providing information, stick to giving only what's necessary. Unnecessary details can increase the risk of sensitive data being exposed. At Paystack, we’re committed to asking only for the information we genuinely need to help you. This speeds up problem-solving and adds an extra layer of security by reducing the amount of data that’s being shared.

Shareable Takeaway
When speaking with customer service agents, share only the requested information to reduce the risk of exposing sensitive data.
 					Share on WhatsApp 				 					Share on Facebook 				 					Share on Twitter 				
Your login details are just for you
Your username and password are more than just login details; they’re the keys to your business online. Just as you wouldn’t hand over your house keys to a stranger, you should treat these credentials with the same level of care and caution. When you share them with a customer service agent, you’re essentially undermining your lock and key. This could not only compromise your account but also risk the information of your customers who’ve trusted you with their data. So when you’re chatting with customer service, remember—those keys are yours alone. Customer service agents have other secure ways to assist you without needing your login details.
Data protection is good business
Being diligent about data protection not only keeps you compliant but also shields your organization from huge fines and reputational damage. Therefore, it’s essential to view data protection as an integral part of your business and always prioritize your organization’s data privacy practices. Here’s a handy guide from the US Federal Trade Commission on how to protect your customers’ personal information.

The evolution of agency banking in Africa
How agency banking in Africa has evolved and where it might be headed

The economics and mechanics of agency banking
Shifting tides in agency banking
Small businesses, big opportunity
Closing the loop with consumer payments
So what happens next?
From the small airtime kiosk in Kumasi, Ghana, to the corner pharmacy in Ejigbo, Nigeria, a network of agents forms the backbone of the financial system that makes payments possible in Africa. Whether it's cash withdrawals and deposits, peer-to-peer (P2P) transfers, or bill payments, these agents are everyday people working on behalf of banks and other financial institutions to make financial services more accessible to businesses and consumers. 
As these agent networks mature, a shift is happening. We’re seeing financial institutions expand and evolve their services, as they pursue new business models, and adapt to changes in their operating environment.
In this article, we’ll explore agent networks, SMEs, where they converge, and how financial service providers are evolving from mere partners to ambitious builders of entire ecosystems.
Telling this story required insights from the operators on the frontlines. Thank you to the several executives who spoke with me about one of the most interesting shifts happening in African finance today.

The state of agency banking today
In Africa, cash is still king for most retail payments, despite the surge in digital payment options. Regulators and financial institutions dream of a digital future, but they still need to design for this cash-driven reality. Initially, this meant providing access to cash through physical bank branches and ATMs, but there’s still a significant gap between the high demand for financial services and the limited supply of banking infrastructure. This gap has driven the use of agents to provide financial services across Africa. 
The first variations of agency banking started in Brazil in the 2000s and adoption eventually spread to the rest of Latin America and Africa. In the mid-2000s, South African legacy banks and mobile money upstarts like MTN Mobile Money and WIZZIT began offering cash deposits and withdrawals through a network of post offices and retail outlets. Across the continent, banks also employed bank sales representatives who would venture into bustling markets and tight-knit local communities, engaging potential customers to open bank accounts and set up debit cards. 
The landscape began to shift dramatically in 2007 when telecom operator Safaricom introduced the M-PESA mobile payment service, using a network of agents as intermediaries for domestic money transfers. This model proved to be a game-changer. Their success sparked a trend, with the model being replicated across the continent by mobile money providers, banks, and fintechs.
Today, agency banking is synonymous with mobile money, but its scope has expanded. Payment providers like Nigeria’s Paga, Egypt’s Fawry, and legacy banks like Nigeria’s First Bank, have successfully scaled agent networks in their respective markets. These financial players team up with businesses and individuals firmly rooted in local communities. The reason is simple but powerful: these agents often have existing relationships with people in the community, building a level of trust that’s crucial for dealing with money. That kind of connection hits home in a way a formal, roaming sales rep can’t match.
Listen to the Decode Fintech podcast episode on Paga
In this episode, Paga CEO Tayo Oviosu tells us the story of how his team built a B2C African fintech success over the course of a decade.
Listen now
This community-first strategy shapes everything from the placement of agent networks to how agents are recruited and managed. Agency banking providers in Nigeria like Paga, Moniepoint, and OPay have deeply connected with communities, relying on local figures to take on roles as regional managers, super-agents, and aggregators. These community leaders take on the job of onboarding and supervising other agents. Instead of forcing a big shift, these players have opted to work with existing community ties and systems to fuel adoption and expansion. 
Agency banking models in Africa are as diverse as the continent itself, adapting to the unique cultural, economic, and regulatory landscapes of the various markets.
In a country like Nigeria, cash withdrawals remain the dominant use case for customers interacting with agents. Here, agents act as human alternatives to ATMs and bank branches, equipped with POS devices and bundles of cash, ready to serve in both dense metropolitan areas and rural regions that lack access to traditional financial services.
In countries like Kenya and Ghana where mobile money is predominant, agents largely act as cash-in/cash-out points for customers to deposit into or withdraw from their mobile wallets. The customers then use their mobile wallets for bill payments, remittances, loans, etc. 
This table breaks down the broad characteristics of the financial service industries one might observe in different African markets, and how their agent networks operate.
The economics and mechanics of agency banking
Agency banking customers include everyone from people withdrawing cash or paying bills, to traders making deposits or supplier payments.
Traditional banks generate most of their revenue by earning interest on customer deposits. So by design, banking customers are charged zero to minimal fees to make deposits, but usually have to pay to move money out. Agency banking, on the other hand, generates most of its income from transactions; therefore, customers are charged for both depositing and withdrawing money. 
The business model for agency banking services is a function of both market forces and regulation. These factors affect not just how much providers can earn from agency banking but also how commissions are split with agents. 
In Nigeria, for example, the fees that providers charge agents for bank transfers and POS transactions are regulated and capped by the Central Bank of Nigeria (CBN). However, the fees the agent charges the end user for deposits and withdrawals are mostly determined by market forces. 
In mobile money markets like Ghana, Kenya, and Senegal, both the fees charged to agents and commissions charged to the end users are set by the mobile money provider.
The fees charged to the customer are usually flat rates but can end up costing the customer up to 5% of the transaction amount. Agents earn most of the gross commissions, irrespective of the model, capturing up to 80% of the total commission per transaction. 
The agency banking provider, who either takes an agreed cut of agent commissions or charges a percentage of the transaction value, earns the smaller share. The take rates for providers are small but large players are able to leverage their scale and transaction activity to negotiate better margins with payment partners and in some cases, cut off these middlemen entirely. 
Smaller agency banking providers that lack the scale and leverage to obtain better terms with payment partners have to contend with thinner margins and usually struggle to compete in the market without losing money. 
The reasoning behind these fees? Agents save you both the time and the travel costs you’d spend getting to and waiting at an ATM or bank branch. Put another way, the fees that agents charge roughly correlate to the average distance to the nearest ATM or bank branch, as well as the average time spent there. 
Beyond just per-transaction fees to processors, agents have to incur other costs to generate these revenues. There are one-time costs like the purchase or lease of POS terminals and the setting up of physical locations. Agents also incur recurring expenses for trips to banks and ATMs, data for the POS devices, utility bills and other critical operational expenses. 
According to a 2018 BCG study of different markets including Nigeria and Kenya, the average mobile money agent incurs about $100 in monthly expenses.

Because an agent's income is closely tied to the number of transactions they process, you’ll often find them concentrated in densely populated urban areas with high foot traffic and lots of commercial activity. Agents in more remote areas charge higher transaction fees, both due to less competition (there are fewer agents in those areas) but also out of necessity, to make up for the lower number of daily transactions.
This landscape has created an interesting situation where underbanked customers in rural areas, who already have limited financial options, end up paying more for financial services than their urban counterparts. It’s a disparity that underscores the challenges of delivering equal financial access across different regions.
In addition to optimizing commissions and costs, agents have to also manage their liquidity. This requires maintaining a timely supply of physical cash (float) for customer withdrawals and an electronic balance (e-float) for transfers and deposits. This fluid mix of cash and digital money comes from a range of sources, including customer deposits, ATM or bank withdrawals, and cash flow from their other businesses. 
One way that agency banking providers help agents better manage liquidity and earn more revenue is by providing faster access to funds. 
When a customer makes a cash withdrawal from an agent, the agent is essentially swapping physical cash with digital money from the customer. Agents then use the digital money available in their e-float to obtain cash from their sources and the cycle repeats. 
This means that an agent’s ability to access physical cash is dependent on how quickly they can access their e-float. Agency banking providers leverage real-time transfer rails to instantly settle that digital money from the customer to the agent (sometimes for a fee). This is particularly helpful for POS transactions which are traditionally not settled on the same day. 
How NIBSS Instant Payment (NIP) powers Nigeria’s digital economy
In a previous Decode Fintech article, we explored how NIP catalyzed the explosive growth of Nigerian fintech innovation.
→ Read the article
As a result of the agency banking providers giving agents instant access to their e-float, the agents avoid running out of cash, but also use the same cash inventory for multiple transactions. 
We can illustrate all this with an example: Let’s say I go to the agent on my street to withdraw ₦10,000 with my debit card. The agent will insert my debit card into a POS device and debit my bank account for ₦10,200, charging a ₦200 commission. I will be handed ₦10,000 in cash and the agent’s electronic balance will be instantly credited with ₦10,150, with ₦50 paid to the agency banking partner. 
If that agent is able to withdraw the ₦10,000 from their electronic balance in cash, they can effectively sell the funds collected from me in cash to another customer. Ultimately, an agent can use the same $10 of monetary value to conduct up to $50 worth of cash transactions in one day, depending on how quickly they can turn over and sell cash in that time. 
This combination of strong customer demand, sizeable gross margins for agents, and creative liquidity management has made agency banking a very attractive business model for all parties involved.

Shifting tides in agency banking
There’s no doubt that agency banking has had a significant impact on financial services in Africa in the 21st century. In some way, the story of digital payments in Africa is very much an offline one. These agents have played a critical role in onboarding new users into the financial system, while also driving activity from banked users.
Agency banking has also provided a healthy source of income for all stakeholders. Pure-play agents (agents who focus solely on agency banking) have been provided with employment opportunities. SMEs that offer agency banking products gain a dual advantage: direct revenue from agency banking and a boost in foot traffic to their establishments, enhancing their overall business.
But shifting tides are exposing gaps in current models and threatening the commission incomes that fuel the industry. 
The number of active financial agents has increased rapidly in the last few years as banks, telcos, and fintechs have rushed into the market. While growth is often seen as a sign of vitality, here it could be a sign of an impending challenge. 
According to GSMA, the number of global mobile money accounts per active agent dropped from about 113 in March 2017 to 85 at the end of 2021. By 2022, the number of active mobile money agents in Sub-Saharan Africa grew by 39%. In that period, the number of active accounts and value of transactions grew 21% and 15% respectively. 
If we consider a mobile money number to be a proxy for a customer to an agent, this implies that the number of agents is growing faster than the number of customers. Said differently, there is now a lot more competition amongst mobile money agents for customers.
 			Source: GSMA
More competition amongst agents is changing the power and pricing dynamics for everyone involved. Commission income now faces a delicate tug-of-war. On one side, customers are looking for ways to pay less, driven by their need for more affordable services. At the same time, agents are pushing to earn higher commissions. Agency banking providers are caught in this dynamic, particularly in Type-2 markets where there's no exclusivity between agent and provider. A single agent acts as the representative of multiple providers, and an agency banking provider whose fees are too high might find themselves dropped by an agent.
It’s a delicate act; agency banking providers have to make pricing models sustainable for the business, while still delivering value to both their customers and their network of agents. Specifically, they must keep fees low for customers, while motivating agents with high commissions, while turning a profit.

In Nigeria, agents are becoming more united, shifting from a fragmented state to forming unions. In July 2023, the Lagos chapter of the Association of Mobile Money and Bank Agents In Nigeria (AMMBAN) proposed controversial fee hikes due to an increase in operational expenses. Key costs like transport, fuel, and the price of POS devices have skyrocketed as many African countries are grappling with high inflation and weak FX. 
Adding complexity to these tensions is the looming presence of digital payments, posing a significant challenge to the entire industry.
In Issue 174 of the Decode Fintech newsletter, we wrote about the idea of cash not just as money but as a physical good:
For the average consumer, cash is usually seen as a tool for commerce or a physical representation of monetary value. But a deeper way to look at cash is as a retail product that's subject to the expected mechanics of commerce, much like a shirt or a tuber of yam.

This means cash has a chain (and cost) of production and distribution. Like any physical good, it can be bought and sold for a profit. It can be warehoused as a deposit with licensed financial institutions. It undergoes variable supply and demand motions that affect its cost, as acutely observed during the cash scarcity period in Nigeria at the beginning of the year. This last bit is particularly important in a country like Nigeria, where most retail transactions are conducted with cash.
Agents already contribute to the cost of distributing cash by earning commissions on withdrawals and deposits. As noted in our article about NIBSS Instant Payments, the cost of producing cash notes can be as high as 5.5% of the monetary value. Agents add to this by charging an additional 2-4% of the transaction amount for cash withdrawals, a practice common in markets like Ghana and Kenya.
So while cash might seem free at the point of commerce, the actual cost of getting the cash to the user to spend in the first place can be as high as about 7-10% of the transaction value. This 'cash tax' is quite steep compared to electronic channels where the overall transaction costs range from 0.1% to 1.6% of the transaction value.
 			Source: CBN, M-PESA, MTN Ghana 		
In the long run, it’s logical for regulators to aim for financial inclusion by cutting down on both the cost and use of cash. A future with low-cost, widespread digital retail payments offers convenience and cost savings for both governments and consumers. However, this threatens agency banking models which rely heavily on commission revenue from cash-based transactions.
The data shows that this trend is underway. According to GSMA, net cash out (cash withdrawals minus deposits) on mobile money has fallen over the last few years as more users are transacting digitally within the mobile money ecosystem. 
During the first half of 2023, mobile money agents in Kenya handled less cash despite mobile money account usage reaching new highs. In all African markets, P2P transfers and merchant payments through digital channels have experienced fast growth.
So while agents continue to play a vital role in transforming physical cash into digital currency, the rise of frictionless digital payments threatens their long-term viability.

In late 2022, the Central Bank of Nigeria (CBN) conducted a monetary policy experiment that gave a preview of what the future of money might look like in the region. First, they announced a redesign of the ₦200, ₦500, and ₦1000 notes with an urgent deadline for the expiry of old notes. Shortly after, they set new cash withdrawal limits for individuals and businesses using banks, ATMs, and agents, leading to a sudden shortage of cash.
Faced with this cash scarcity, people turned to electronic channels more, like P2P money transfers and card payments at Point of Sale (POS) terminals to pay for goods and services. This shift away from cash led to a spike in transaction activity for banks and fintechs.
These policy changes had a detrimental effect on the agency banking industry. POS agents and their partner financial institutions (who earn revenue by charging fees on cash withdrawals) found themselves in a difficult situation. With cash in short supply, agents had to hike up their per-transaction fees, but the limited availability of physical money meant that there was less cash to dispense to customers. This led to fewer transactions overall and a drop in revenue.
These policies were later paused but still presented an existential risk to millions of agents and teased the fate of agency banking in a very possible cashless future.
For agency banking providers, the current landscape creates an immediate need to address several pressing concerns:
Identify ways to stand out from competitors to agents, beyond just pricing and reliability.
Extract the greatest value from agents and grow payments revenue in the short to medium term, especially as long-term trends shift towards digital transactions.
This presents an opportunity to tackle these existential threats while exploring new business paths. This is especially true for Type-1 market players like M-PESA and MTN MoMo, which are already experiencing slower revenue growth rates as they hit market saturation and the maturation of mobile money.

Agency banking providers are adopting a playbook that involves serving businesses and customers directly and bypassing the traditional agents who once mediated these relationships; this has mixed implications for the agents.
Small businesses, big opportunity
Small and Medium Enterprises (SMEs) form the backbone of Africa’s economy, making up 90% of the businesses and 80% of the jobs across the continent. Despite this concentration of economic activity, attention from legacy financial institutions has been lukewarm, and the tools and services on offer haven’t quite met the unique needs of these merchants.
SMEs often grapple with inconsistent cash flow, resulting in relatively low amounts of deposits at any given moment. Additionally, most SMEs, particularly micro-businesses, are informal establishments that rely heavily on traditional, paper-based bookkeeping and financial processes. Even those that are formally recognized still collect most of their payments in cash.
This makes it tough for traditional financial institutions with formal rules to earn sizeable interest on deposits or adequately underwrite these SMEs for loans. Limited access to funds and a lack of relevant business tools are critical problems that need urgent solutions. These challenges become more complex as we explore different industries, business models, levels of formality, and customer types.
Many traditional banking institutions tend to serve SMEs and retail customers in exactly the same way. That means for the majority of SMEs, the typical services banks offer include only a bank account, a debit card, and access to a mobile app or internet banking platform; there are rarely value-added services that successfully optimize for small business owners.
Governments and Development Finance Institutions (DFIs) have set up community banks and micro-finance institutions, but their success has still been mixed. African businesses continue to face a shortage in credit and other essential banking services like payments, foreign exchange management, and bookkeeping.
Agency banking providers typically have existing relationships with SMEs. This familiarity comes either from SMEs engaging in agency banking services themselves, or through business owners who transact with agents. The overlap of these connections could generate actionable insights. 
Foot traffic from customers seeking agency banking services from SMEs can act as a good signal of the overall business activity of the SMEs and can be used to profile these businesses for other types of financial services.
Both agency banking and small business commerce require careful cash flow management. Agents need to balance physical cash and electronic funds, while SMEs must ensure the cash from sales covers expenses. Float management can be complex on its own, and the challenge becomes even greater when both operations are run from the same location.
Following these assumptions, there’s value in not only bringing commerce operations and agency banking together, but in using this knowledge to directly serve SMEs. Becoming a unified hub for banking and business management for SMEs offers additional benefits for financial institutions, such as:
Increasing revenue opportunities: By understanding the business’ needs and behaviors, financial institutions can offer higher-margin services like credit, insurance, and payments, thereby enhancing the average revenue per business.
Improving agent retention: In an environment where agents have no exclusive relationship with an agency banking provider, valued added services are a way for providers to differentiate themselves from competing institutions. Agency banking providers might even go as far as rewarding agents for higher volumes. For example, the agency banking provider might offer more generous credit terms on the condition of the agent/SME sending higher transaction volumes.
Preparing for a digital future: In the long run, as payments and commerce shift towards digital and cashless transactions, the tools initially used for agency banking, like POS terminals or mobile money accounts, can evolve into platforms for receiving and managing customer payments. Agency banking providers that adopt this approach will also be better positioned to provide suitable online commerce and payment tools like web checkouts and online storefronts.

In our 2022 review of African fintech, we noted the emergence of agency banking providers pivoting to serve SMEs directly:
… some agency banking providers adapted by transforming into full-service banks and converting their agents into business customers. Moniepoint, a major player in Nigeria, launched Moniepoint Microfinance Bank, offering loans and financial management tools to merchants. Similarly, Kudi rebranded as Nomba and introduced new savings and payment tools for businesses. 
Similar trends are noticeable in markets like Kenya and Egypt, where merchant payments are becoming a substantial part of revenue from agent-based giants like Fawry and M-PESA.
Despite the opportunity, there’s no certainty of success. Informal, cash-heavy markets are tricky. There’s no guarantee that agents, who might also be SMEs, will readily embrace these new payment and banking solutions.
Also, agency banking isn’t the only route to business banking. With the market’s significant size and challenging issues, there’s been a surge in startups using various entry points. Whether through supply chain management, bookkeeping, working capital, online payments, or insurance, these companies are acquiring merchant bases and growing into full-service banks.
Finally, it’s worth considering that, given enough time and resources, most agency banking providers could reach a level where their merchant-focused products and value-added services are essentially the same. This lack of differentiation may become a hurdle. Ultimately, simply offering merchants a complete set of banking solutions might not be enough to stand out. 
2022 in African fintech: Exploring the biggest African fintech stories that shaped the year
In our review of 2022 in African fintech, we explored how agency banking saw sustained growth amidst shifting business models.
→ Read the article
Closing the loop with consumer payments
Many agency banking providers already offer consumer solutions. Take Kenya’s M-PESA and Nigeria’s OPay, for example; they combine their agent networks with widely used mobile wallets for transfers, merchant payments, lending, and other financial services.
However, not all agency banking providers have ventured into consumer solutions. This is especially true in countries like Nigeria, where payment systems are interoperable, allowing consumers to engage with any agent using a payment card. Fintech companies like Moniepoint and Nomba have been able to grow by focusing solely on the merchant side of things. But this strategy isn’t without risks.

Recent events, such as the Central Bank of Nigeria’s (CBN) new policies on banknote swaps and cash withdrawals, have highlighted a potential danger in putting all their eggs in one basket and focusing only on businesses. It’s a reminder that a balanced approach, considering both merchants and consumers, may provide a more stable foundation. 
In Issue 166 of the Decode Fintech newsletter, we wrote:
With the traditional banks struggling to handle this sudden traffic, mobile wallets and digital neobanks emerged as reliable alternatives[…] For a fintech like Moniepoint, the impact was a bit more nuanced. The merchant banking and payments acceptance side of the business likely saw increased activity as customers shifted to paying merchants via electronic methods. But the cash withdrawal business likely also saw a decline as the cash scarcity worsened.

Additionally, unlike its biggest agency banking competitors - First Bank’s FirstMonie, OPay, PalmPay, Paga, and Interswitch’s PayPoint - Moniepoint doesn’t own a consumer product. In December 2022, the volume of monthly POS transactions in Nigeria dipped year-on-year by 14%, the first decline on record. Mobile transfers and NIP transactions however reached YoY increases of 122% and 413% in February 2023.

This suggests that competitors who had a direct relationship with consumers were able to soften the blow to their agency banking cash withdrawal business with increased digital payments on their consumer interfaces. Also, because Moniepoint (unlike these consumer apps) only operates on the acquirer side of a merchant payment, they don’t have much control over issuer-side reliability which was a big reason for dips in service quality for merchant POS payments.

Following the reversal of the CBN policies, MoniePoint led a seed round into Payday, a consumer and cross-border payments solution with reports of a planned acquisition.
Since that time, mobile inter-scheme transfers (transfers done through institutions with mobile money operator licenses such as Opay and PalmPay) have exploded, surpassing POS transactions in December 2022 and on course to surpass bank transfers by 2024 at the current rate. Moniepoint has also launched its own personal banking product directed at consumers.
 			Dec '22 - Mobile money transfers overtake POS in Nigeria 		
We expect even more agency banking providers to follow this route. Having a direct relationship with consumers through payments, credit and savings solutions has standalone benefits, but there are even more advantages in connecting that base of users to an ecosystem of merchants and agents.
Cutting out middlemen and processing transactions in-house can lead to noticeable cost savings and increased reliability. As we’ve written in a past Decode Fintech issue, transforming external API calls into internal SQL queries can significantly enhance both transaction margins and success rates.
These cost savings can be strategically invested in driving customers towards the businesses and agents within the provider’s networks. Tactics like promotions and special pricing for consumers who pay through merchants in the ecosystem can be effective in attracting more business and strengthening the relationship between merchants, agents, and customers. 
Just like with building merchant solutions, this approach comes with its own set of risks. Acquiring and retaining African consumers can be a complex and costly endeavour, with uncertain revenue outcomes. However, a consumer offering can act as a valuable safeguard against disruptions in the cash-based system and can significantly enhance merchant-side operations. 
In a sense, this is where Type-1 and Type-2 market types begin to converge. The playbook, successfully executed across various African countries, often begins with enabling a network of human agents, followed by building a digital ecosystem of consumers and businesses. The order of the steps might change, but the destination is often the same.
*In many countries, debit cards are still called ATM cards today.
Interestingly, the success of this approach reveals something non-intuitive yet fundamental about cash-heavy markets like Africa: successful stories about reducing the use of cash often begin with developing solutions that make access to cash easier, safer, and faster, rather than diminishing it. The wisdom here lies in understanding and accommodating the prevailing needs before steering the market towards more digital solutions.
While digital-first solutions have found success by tapping into the growing digital trend across the continent, numerous failed government cashless policies and fintech businesses stem from a fundamental misunderstanding of why cash usage continues. It’s not just about pushing digital solutions; it’s about recognizing why cash is still preferred in many areas and finding the right ways to reduce its usage. Understanding the unique dynamics of cash reliance can lead to more effective strategies in moving towards a more digitally inclusive economy.

So what happens next?
Most of these shifts to merchant and consumer solutions mainly benefit consumers and agency banking providers, while agents may face challenges. For agents who don’t operate a primary merchant business, the transition to a fully digital system could lead to a significant loss of revenue or even the entire income from their business.
Fortunately for these agents, the grand transition to digital payments is still in progress, and a complete disruption is likely years away. Cash continues to reign as the preferred payment method across Africa, as many Africans still lack access to digital payment tools. The experience in Nigeria illustrates that a sudden push towards cashless payments can have serious repercussions on consumers, businesses, and the overall economy. 
Also, historical trends suggest that there’s likely to always be a demand for agent-based models. Agents fundamentally help bridge trust gaps in low-trust economies like Africa. This trust gap is prominent in financial services but also exists in other areas. 
In our 2022 review of African fintech, we noted: 
Beyond fintech, various sectors embraced the agency model to deliver goods and services. Ecommerce companies like Copia Global (Kenya), Brimore (Egypt), and Tushop (Kenya) raised money in 2022 to drive their agent-led ecommerce models across different African markets.
Agents also solve distribution problems that are particular to emerging markets. From timed phone calls (where people who want to make a phone call pay walk to their local phone call agent) to agents selling airtime vouchers, and even agents selling access to time on Playstation consoles, variants of the agent economy have thrived in Africa where incomes per capita are still low compared to the initial costs of directly owning new technology. Eventually, these innovations become cheaper for direct distribution and personal ownership but the agent networks evolve and emerge for the next new thing.
However, it’s worth considering that the rising adoption of consumer platforms like smartphones and internet could eventually make it easier and cheaper to distribute new technologies in the future. This is what has essentially happened with software and mobile apps which are now available directly to consumers at almost zero marginal cost. In that situation, agents who act as mediators between consumers and technologies might see their role diminished in the future. 
For the time being, these agents will likely be fine. But if they look around and ahead, there are signs of change that stand to benefit everyone but them.

More Nigerians are choosing to pay via bank transfer…
One of the most interesting trends we’re tracking at Paystack is the growth of bank transfer as a preferred payment channel for consumers. In 2021, about 12% of payments on Paystack in Nigeria were made with a bank transfer. Two years later, that number has grown to 34%.
This is why we’re investing heavily in product updates to provide better tools for bank transfer payments. For example, last week, Paystack announced a major infrastructure upgrade and speed improvement to our bank transfer product.
Where most comparable transfer solutions require over 60 seconds or more to be confirmed, 99% of bank transfers collected via the proprietary Paystack-Titan bank transfer channel are confirmed within 8 seconds.
...but the experience of in-store bank transfer payments could be a lot better
When it comes to in-person payments, bank transfers remain popular, but the experience around receiving in-store bank transfers is usually very poor for customers, frontline staff, and business owners.
Many Nigerians who have paid for a product or service via bank transfer have experienced the situation where they send the transfer, but then need to wait a long time for the sales agent to contact their manager to verify that the payment was successful.
It’s frustrating for the customer, inconvenient for the frontline staff, and distracting for the manager who fields several requests a day to confirm whether the transfer was successful. It’s a poor experience all around.
Fast in-person bank transfer payments, at scale
With Virtual Terminal, every sales agent or frontline staff can be assigned a unique virtual bank account number. When a customer transfers money to that bank account, the sales agent gets an instant confirmation via WhatsApp, and the customer can be on their way.
Business admins can create as many virtual bank account numbers as they need and assign them to different sales agents or store locations. This eliminates the operational burden of managing multiple POS devices, enabling businesses a swift and cost-effective way to ramp up their sales force.

Deploy your point-of-sale solution in seconds
Virtual Terminal is incredibly easy to scale, whether you have just 1 frontline person in 1 store, or 1,000 sales agents across several cities. You simply create as many virtual bank account numbers as you need and assign them to your sales agents, all from your Paystack Dashboard.
When customers then pay via Virtual Terminal, you receive the payments in your preferred bank account, together with the rest of your Paystack payout. Virtual Terminal dramatically simplifies your business operations.
You’re in control
 			Sales agents receive WhatsApp notifications when payment is successful 		
When you assign virtual bank accounts to your sales agents, they receive a notification via WhatsApp for successful payments. The 'successful payment' alert is the only thing that the agent sees: the notification does not contain any additional information such as the total amount of money your business has received. Only you, the administrator of the business, can access that information via the Paystack Dashboard.
Additionally, you can disable a Virtual Terminal bank account number at any time, change the WhatsApp number tied to it, and also set it up so that multiple WhatsApp numbers receive an alert when a bank transfer is made.
Give your customers multiple in-person payment options
 			Customers can pay through multiple payment methods 		
Beyond bank transfers, your customers can scan a QR code and access multiple payment channels, including card payments (American Express, Visa, Mastercard, Verve), USSD, and Apple Pay.
Each Virtual Terminal account also comes with a beautiful, autogenerated poster which you can print from the Paystack Dashboard and prominently display, to inform the customers about the wide range of payment methods available to them. Some businesses choose to display this poster as a table tent, while some others create a smart-looking lanyard that staff can easily carry around.
However your customer prefers to pay, you’ll be able to accept that payment, seamlessly.
Here’s how to download your Virtual Terminal posters →
Delight international clients with seamless in-person payments
Businesses with lots of international clients, such as hotels and restaurants, are familiar with foreign-issued cards failing on locally-issued POS devices in Nigeria.
With Virtual Terminal, your international customers can reliably scan to pay with their foreign-issued cards or Apple Pay; you’ll no longer have to turn down good business.
All the other benefits that come with accepting payments with Paystack
Virtual Terminal comes with all the other benefits of the Paystack ecosystem of products:
Split payments: If you run a company that has several lines of business, Virtual Terminal allows you to receive one payment and automatically split different amounts into separate business bank accounts.
Easy end-of-day accounting: If you run multiple stores and also accept payments online, you can get instant visibility into all your transactions — online and offline — on your Paystack Dashboard. You also get useful, granular data on each sale made via each Terminal, so that you can instantly identify your best sales reps, and most profitable stores.
Track all payments from your phone: You can easily monitor all your payments and reconcile your accounts from the Paystack Merchant App (iOS and Android). Download the app to get started!

The psychology of shapes
This may be a challenge for some of you — imagine that you’re seeing these characters for the very first time 👇🏾
 			Characters from The Powerpuff Girls and Phineas & Ferb 		
What comes to your mind when you look at each one?
Professor probably strikes notes of intellect, dependability, and maybe even support. Doofenshmirtz might seem like a dangerous, slightly deranged, and unpredictable character. Bubbles looks cute and harmless.
Without knowledge of their behaviors in the cartoons they star in, we’re able to attribute personality to them.
Why? Because of something called shape language. Walt Disney’s education resource defines shape language as a concept used in art and animation to communicate meaning based on shapes we’re familiar with.
Shareable Takeaway
Shape language is a concept used in art and animation to communicate meaning based on shapes we’re familiar with. Here's how we applied it in designing a mascot for our internal podcast.
 					Share on WhatsApp 				 					Share on Facebook 				 					Share on Twitter 				
Square or rectangular characters denote sturdiness, reliability, and strength.
Triangles are sharp and directional. They communicate a sense of danger and unpredictability in characters.
Circular characters are usually portrayed as soft, warm, and approachable.
Defining a character’s visual identity
We recently launched an internal podcast called Paystack FM. To add a fun element, we also introduced Chairman — a quirky, witty mascot who drops boisterously whimsical announcements of new episodes weekly. While his character is sharp and charismatic, Stacks (Paystack team members) were won over by his captivating visuals.
Chairman’s designer, Mariam, shared insights into her process for refining the rooster’s visual identity with input from other teammates and an understanding of the principle of shape language.
Mariam expressed that her intent for Paystack FM’s brand identity was for it to embody Stacks and possess a strong character. The rooster was one of four options that she presented during feedback sessions with the team, and its strong character and promising visuals drew everyone in. After multiple rounds of feedback, she was able to go down a visual path for the rooster’s character.
She began by exploring different versions of the character, polishing the concept with each iteration.
 			Exploring the rooster with props like a radio, glasses, and headphones 		
She then properly defined the radio as the secondary element of the character. Both the rooster and the radio began to look polished but still lacked the edgy, coarse quality that she envisioned for Paystack FM’s quirky mascot.
 			Further refinement of the rooster. Too polished and neat. Next! 		
Communicating personality using shape language
At this point, she had a discussion with Kaz, Art Director at Paystack, and he pointed out something that sparked an epiphany for Mariam. Had she considered the shape language of the character? The rounded shapes softened the look of the rooster, signalling a delicate friendliness. Instead, sharp corners on the mascot could help her achieve the edgy look she desired.
With this input, Mariam began the third leg of character refinement.
 			Rounded shapes vs. sharp shapes 		
At last, the strong character was beginning to take shape. Mariam began to apply the concept of shape language to other parts like the rooster’s eyes and the radio. The formerly rounded eyes were sharpened for an intense look from the rooster, and the formerly rounded radio elements (seen in the previous iterations) were squared out.
The finishing touches were added, and the character, Chairman, was ready.
Once Mariam released Chairman into the wild, she was able to extend the concept of shape language to influence typography choices and character poses to maintain consistency with Chairman’s strong personality.

Mariam’s work highlights the significance of shapes in character design and also how crucial it is to get the technical details right. It reiterates that understanding shape language is not just an artistic endeavor but an intentional communication tool that can make or break a visual identity. By taking a deep dive into shape language, she was able to not only enhance the design outcome but also enrich the story being told.

How to create Paystack Virtual Accounts
Live Q&A: How Savings, Lending, and Wallet Operator companies use Paystack Dedicated Virtual Accounts to drive growth
Common questions
Accept instant, reliable bank transfer payments, at scale
Three years ago, we introduced Paystack Virtual Accounts — auto-generated bank accounts that allow businesses in Nigeria accept bank transfer payments from customers. Since 2020, we’ve processed over 170 million unique transactions for over 60,000 businesses via Paystack Virtual Accounts in partnership with Wema Bank, Access Bank, and Zenith Bank.
Today, we’re excited to announce Paystack-Titan, a blazing fast improvement to Virtual Accounts, that allows businesses accept bank transfers instantly, reliably, and at scale. Where most comparable transfer products require over 60 seconds or more to be confirmed, 99% of bank transfers collected via Paystack-Titan are confirmed within 8 seconds.
What’s a Paystack Virtual Account?
A Paystack Virtual Account is a digital bank account created on your behalf or in your customer’s name to enable seamless payments via bank transfer.
For example, when your customer chooses the Pay with Transfer option on the Paystack Checkout, we automatically create a virtual bank account number on your behalf, to which they can send the bank transfer. The money sent to this account number is then forwarded to the same payout bank account where you receive all payments you collect from Paystack.
Thousands of businesses — from savings startups to food delivery services — also use Paystack Virtual Accounts to assign Dedicated Virtual Accounts to their customers.
Virtual Accounts and Dedicated Virtual Accounts are fundamentally the same technology — a virtual bank account, to which a customer can make a bank transfer. The difference is that, while the Virtual Accounts generated on the Paystack Checkout are randomized and temporary, a Dedicated Virtual Account is a permanent bank account number that a business can assign to a specific customer, to enable repeat bank transfer payments from that customer.
For example, a savings fintech could use Paystack Dedicated Virtual Accounts to generate a bank account for each of their customers. Each saver receives a custom bank account number, to which the saver can send instant bank transfers anytime they want to put money away for saving.
Over the years, we’ve partnered with Wema Bank, Access Bank, and Zenith Bank to create Virtual Accounts, and now, we’re excited to extend this relationship to our friends at Titan Trust Bank, a commercial bank licensed by the Central Bank of Nigeria.
Paystack-Titan offers an even faster, and more reliable Pay with Transfer experience
Paystack-Titan is a partnership between Paystack and Titan Trust Bank. The partnership enables customers to make instant, reliable bank transfers at scale to Paystack merchants.
The Paystack-Titan relationship allows Paystack to integrate directly with the Nigerian Interbank Settlement System (NIBSS), which gives us real-time insights into the progress of every single transaction and helps us deliver a markedly superior customer experience.
Shareable Takeaway
Paystack-Titan is a partnership between Paystack and Titan Trust Bank that allows blazing fast, reliable bank transfers at scale for businesses in Nigeria.
 					Share on WhatsApp 				 					Share on Facebook 				 					Share on Twitter 				
In practice, this translates to extremely high reliability and high success rates (you’ll get your money every time the customer attempts a valid payment), very fast bank transfers (the transaction will be completed in seconds), and instant refunds in the rare case where there’s an issue with a payment.
To complete a transfer to a Paystack-Titan bank account, customers can go to their bank or wallet app, and then search for and choose 'Paystack-Titan' from the list of destination banks — the exact same process they follow when making transfers to any other bank account.
How to create Paystack Virtual Accounts
Paystack Virtual Account is already enabled by default for the Pay with Transfer channel on the Paystack Checkout, for all businesses in Nigeria.
So if a customer chooses to pay you via Pay with Transfer, they’ll see a virtual bank account number created on your behalf to which they can make an instant bank transfer. This feature is already enabled by default.
Dedicated Virtual Accounts, on the other hand, require a little bit of setup. You can create Dedicated Virtual Accounts from the Paystack Dashboard, or via API.
From your Paystack Dashboard, go to the Customers page, and select the customer for whom you’d like to create virtual accounts. Then select the Dedicated Virtual Account tab, and follow the on-screen instructions. All you need is the customer’s full name, phone number, and email address.

Paystack Design's collective brain
How we created design principles to guide our work and improve our team's communication
 					Artwork by Mariam Omoyele

Considerations to create design principles
How we created Paystack’s design principles
What happens when twenty designers try to collaborate and produce work together remotely? Everyone designs in their own bubbles, in their own brains, without the influence of their peers.
To produce high-quality work consistently, your team must stay in sync. However, meetings, messages, and even Loom videos can waste time and distract your team. Is there an alternative?
At Paystack, the Design team created a collective brain in the form of clear design principles that bind our team and help us communicate efficiently.
This article outlines the considerations and steps we used to create our design principles.
Shareable Takeaway
Solid design principles can help a team produce high-quality work consistently. Here's how we created ours.
 					Share on WhatsApp 				 					Share on Facebook 				 					Share on Twitter 				
Considerations to create design principles
1. Simplicity
Principles that are simple and applicable give the team direction that they can use every day.
We like how WhatsApp’s shared values give clear guidance on how to produce work.
 			WhatsApp's shared values. Source: Medium
A trap when creating principles is to make them too comprehensive. If your principles are difficult to remember, no one will use them. For example, we think that the communication principles of 37signals are inspiring, but a more concise version might be easier to remember and apply.
 			The 37signals Guide to Internal Communication. Source: 37signals
2. Practicality
We wanted our principles to be practical by making them more execution-focused.
WhatsApp’s shared values are an example of how clear execution principles can make ‘philosophical’ principles melt away and give your team actionable guidance.
A philosophical principle like ‘delight in customer support’ is too vague. An execution-focused principle like ‘we respond in less than 15 minutes’ can easily be applied by your team.
3. Purpose
Make sure your principles have a purpose behind them.
Ask yourself what your principles are supposed to encourage. Efficiency to get things done? Enjoyment of work? Higher quality products for customers?
In the WhatsApp example, their purpose for creating principles was to be more efficient and communicate less to achieve their goals together.
 			WhatsApp's shared values. Source: Medium
Shareable Takeaway
Design principles should be simple, practical, and purpose-driven, turning vague ideas into clear, actionable guidance.
 					Share on WhatsApp 				 					Share on Facebook 				 					Share on Twitter 				
How we created Paystack’s design principles
Based on those considerations, we took the following steps to create our own design principles.
1. Collaboration
The Paystack design team collaborated to create our design principles.
We used FigJam, Slack, and Notion to asynchronously brainstorm and finished with a synchronous Zoom call. The principles emerged out of the process.
 			Expand to see the initial brainstorm ideas 		
2. Categorisation
We split our principles into two buckets: team principles and work principles.
Our team principles are more philosophical and guide the way we approach our team’s work overall. Our work principles are more practical and guide the execution of our work.
 			Our current team principles 		
3. Publishing
Most importantly, our principles are not hidden in a Google Slide somewhere. Our principles are always accessible to anyone in the company within our Design teamspace in Notion.
 			The Notion page that lists our team principles and work principles 		
Shareable Takeaway
Build design principles by generating initial ideas as a team, then refine and categorize the final selections. Remember to make them visible, so your team and others can easily find and apply them.
 					Share on WhatsApp 				 					Share on Facebook 				 					Share on Twitter 				
The journey doesn't end here. In a few months, we'll evaluate how our design principles have been integrated into the team's collective brain. Our vision is to see these principles become deeply embedded into our team's work and hear our team members report that it's become easier to consistently produce high-quality work together.

2022 in African fintech: Exploring the biggest African fintech stories that shaped the year
A detailed exploration of the most important fintech stories, trends, and themes, across the continent in 2022

The year ahead
2022 marked another captivating chapter in African fintech as the sector navigated a rapidly evolving landscape. As avid observers and active participants, Decode Fintech and Paystack have had a front seat to these developments, giving us unique insights into the stories that defined the year. 
Join us as we explore the themes that shaped fintech in Africa in 2022, and what they might mean for the ecosystem in 2023.
Investments, Mergers, and Acquisitions
Global VC slowdown impacted African fintech funding in 2022
While fintech still holds the title for the most funded tech sector in Africa, with $1.9 billion in funding, there’s no denying that 2022 was a challenging year for fintech fundraising. The value of venture capital investments into African fintechs declined by 41% compared to the previous year. But the problem wasn’t exclusive to Africa. Tech companies all over the world struggled to attract VC funding. What caused this conservative behaviour? Various factors including rising interest rates, falling company valuations, and uncertain economic conditions.
Despite the slowdown in investments, several funds emerged with a heightened focus on African fintech. The Kigali International Financial Centre (KIFC)announced a $50m African fintech-focused fund. Global giants Visa and Google committed to investing $1 billion each in the continent over the next five years. Quona Capital raised $322m to invest in fintechs across emerging markets, including Africa.
Within fintech, payments, credit, and banking were some of the most heavily funded sub-sectors. Though most of these VC deals were seed and Series A funding, there were a few memorable growth stage deals like Flutterwave’s massive $250m Series D, Interswitch’s $110m raise, and MFS Africa's $100m Series C extension.
Notwithstanding these large raises for a handful of companies in 2022, ongoing macroeconomic headwinds imply that we can expect to see the difficult fundraising environment persist into 2023. African fintechs might have difficulty raising follow-on funding with desired valuations. This concern is particularly acute for pan-African, growth-stage fintechs who were already struggling to attract deals before the VC downturn.

Exits, acquisitions, and whispers of an IPO
Exits provide the needed return on investments for founders, investors, and employees while providing fresh capital for new ventures. 2022 recorded a series of notable fintech acquisitions like MFS Africa’s purchase of card issuing fintech, Global Technology Partners (GTP), Chipper Cash’s acquisition of Zambian fintech Zoona, and Weaver Fintech’s acquisition of buy-now-pay-later startup, Pay Just Now. 
These acquisitions aided expansion into new countries (like with Chipper Cash and Zoona) or bundled complementary product offerings to existing users (like with MFS Africa and GTP). 
 			Notable mergers and acquisitions in African fintech in 2022 		
In 2022, there were also reports of a planned IPO by payment processor Flutterwave. If this happens, it would provide a wealth of valuable data necessary to better index the health of the African fintech ecosystem, and would provide an important data point for the viability of IPOs for African fintechs.
Products, Markets, and Business Models
Constrained access to capital put pressure on African fintechs to rein in costs 
Given the difficult fundraising environment and other business pressures, many African fintechs tightened their belts. 
There were reported layoffs at companies including Wave, Chipper Cash, Kuda, and Quidax. Other companies pulled out of markets, or streamlined their product suite. For example, Wave paused expansion and focused efforts on their key markets - Cote D’Ivoire and Senegal, while Société Générale shut down their Yup mobile money app.
As the African fintech industry faces sustained constriction of easy capital, there will be far-reaching implications of everything from how fintechs price their solutions, to what they decide to build. Startups are, by their nature, expected to grow rapidly. If that growth can’t be subsidised by venture capital, it will result in some pretty difficult changes in how these companies do business moving forward.
Telcos expanded their fintech services
Mobile money in Africa has matured considerably from its simple origins into a complex, critical service used by millions of Africans. The 2023 GSMA Mobile Money report revealed that global mobile money transactions reached $1.26 trillion in value in 2022, with Africa accounting for about 66% of this value.

Africa’s mobile money landscape continued to be dominated by big Mobile Network Operators like MTN, Orange, and Safaricom. Most of these telcos reported record growth and revenue contributions from mobile money and fintech activities in 2022.
Driven by this growth (and regulatory requirements in some markets), MTN, Airtel, and Safaricom disclosed plans to spin off their fintech arms into separate companies. In October 2022, Airtel Kenya announced Airtel Money, its mobile money business. Safaricom and M-Pesa are also expected to split in 2023.
These telco-led mobile money solutions are also expanding into new markets and launching new product offerings. In 2022, MTN and Airtel launched Payment Service Banks (PSBs) in Nigeria (we previously explained how MTN’s MoMo PSB could change the landscape of Nigerian financial services) while Safaricom and Vodafone expanded into new markets like Ethiopia and Tanzania, respectively.
Telco mobile money providers broadened their offerings to include services like lending, card issuing, ecommerce, insurance, and digital identity solutions. For example, Safaricom launched an interest-free loan solution that allows M-Pesa customers in Kenya shop for goods and pay later, while in South Africa, MTN partnered with Sanlam to introduce insurance products.
But despite this growth, telco incumbents still faced some challenges. In January, MTN and Airtel both experienced slower-than-expected growth with their PSB launches. MTN, in particular, lost money to fraud within the first three months. Additionally, Nigerian telcos continued to clash with the banks over an unclaimed $185 million USSD usage debt which might potentially lead to a service disruption in 2023.
Understanding MTN Nigeria’s PSB License
In a previous Decode Fintech article, we explored what MTN’s PSB license might mean for customers, fintechs, and financial inclusion in Nigeria.

In other regions, Orange faced stiff competition from well-funded challenger Wave, which reportedly offered lower fees and a better customer experience, resulting in Orange losing market share. Additionally, mobile money customers in Ghana, Cameroon, and Tanzania were levied with new taxes on money movement which directly affected customer usage.
Despite these setbacks, we anticipate that incumbents will leverage their extensive distribution networks to convert core voice and data users into fintech consumers.

Agency banking saw sustained growth amidst shifting business models
In 2022, the number of financial agents – a network of individuals and businesses that serve as intermediaries for financial services within their communities – experienced remarkable growth. According to the 2023 GSMA Mobile Money report, the number of active mobile money agents worldwide surged by 25% to 7.2 million agents in 2022. Africa was the world’s largest mobile money market with ~66% of the global transaction value. In 2022, MTN MoMo, one of Africa’s biggest mobile money operators, reported approximately 1.1 million active MoMo agents, up 27% from the previous year.

The growth wasn’t limited to agent density; the range of services provided by agents also broadened significantly. Beyond fintech, various sectors embraced the agency model to deliver goods and services. Ecommerce companies like Copia Global (Kenya), Brimore (Egypt), and Tushop (Kenya) raised money in 2022 to drive their agent-led ecommerce models across different African markets.
But we’re starting to see changes in the operating dynamics of agency banking. A saturation of agents and increased adoption of electronic P2P and C2B payments has threatened the commissions from cash withdrawals that agents rely on. According to GSMA, active agents in Sub-Saharan Africa processed about $2,000 less per month in cash-in/cash-out (CICO) transactions in 2021 compared to 2016. This trend has been fueled by factors such as increased smartphone and internet penetration, greater user literacy, and new policies that limit cash withdrawals.
In response to this shift, some agency banking providers adapted by transforming into full-service banks and converting their agents into business customers. Moniepoint, a major player in Nigeria, launched Moniepoint Microfinance Bank, offering loans and financial management tools to merchants. Similarly, Kudi rebranded as Nomba and introduced new savings and payment tools for businesses. M-Pesa and MTN MoMo continued to promote their merchant acceptance solutions across various markets.
Other agency banking providers ventured into consumer payments. E-Settlement, the Nigeria-based company behind PayCenter - an agency banking platform - launched the Yep! app, which successfully raised $1.5 million in funding. They’re entering into a highly competitive space with major players like OPay, Palmpay, and Paga.
As more African central banks enact more policies to more aggressively incentivize digital payments, we expect more agency banking operators to continue exploring both merchant and consumer solutions.
More fintechs began serving SMEs
Beyond agency banking pivots, there seemed to be a growing emphasis on catering to African SMEs with banking and financial management tools. These SME-focused fintechs entered the market with a single offering and gradually expanded their range of services.
We’ve already mentioned M-Pesa and Moniepoint, but there are other notable examples of this trend. Kippa, a bookkeeping software provider in Nigeria, launched payment processing, invoicing, and business registration solutions for its customers. In South Africa, Telkom Business launched Telkom Lend, a credit product for small businesses. Additionally, Float, which offers working capital to startups and businesses, acquired Accounteer, an accounting software provider, and has positioned their joint services as a comprehensive operating system for SMEs.
As these competing companies converge on a similar same set of services, it will be interesting to observe how they eventually differentiate themselves. While SMEs contribute significantly to the continent’s economic activity, they’re not a monolithic group. Their business needs differ depending on industry, size, and geography, so a general-purpose toolkit might not work for everyone. It will be interesting to see which lucrative niches these fintechs identify and what special solutions they craft to fit specific industries.

A mixed year for card issuing
Payment cards remain a popular choice for non-cash transactions in Africa. Traditionally issued through commercial banks, fintechs and mobile money wallets leaned into issuing their own cards. 
Several partnerships were announced between the card networks and financial service players. For example, M-Pesa and Visa, Cellulant and Mastercard, and OPay and Mastercard.
The surge in card adoption was driven by customer demand, competition, and an increase in card acceptance touchpoints.
However, 2022 also presented notable challenges for card issuers. From my conversations with industry operators, a scarcity of smart chips used in cards affected the availability and pricing of physical cards. This prompted a re-evaluation of card programs and their overall viability.
The scarcity of foreign currency in 2022 also altered the card issuing landscape. Numerous Nigerian banks reduced the spending limits for international transactions on local cards, with some setting limits as low as $5 a month or suspending international payments altogether.
Even so, the demand for higher-limit international payments persisted - a demand that challenger neobanks in Nigeria were happy to meet with USD virtual cards that had higher transaction limits. But these solutions were expensive. Customers complained about very high Foreign Exchange (FX) conversion rates and service reliability. Additionally, the extreme difficulty in sourcing USD puts the long-term viability of these USD virtual card products into question.
FX issues also affected the backend costs of running card programs. The big card networks and international issuer-processors charged most of their fees in USD - a currency that has risen sharply against most African currencies. This led to increased costs for processing card payments and issuing cards. In response, countries like Nigeria announced plans to launch AfriGo, a domestic card scheme in partnership with NIBSS, to mitigate some of these challenges.
Card fraud remained a tricky problem for both established banks and new card issuers. Many banks insisted on additional authentication for card payments, while players like Union 54 had their services suspended by the card networks for increased fraud on their issued cards. The suspension of Union 54’s services particularly impacted numerous fintechs that relied on their card issuing infrastructure. 
Given the concerns around fraud, Eyowo positioned their Better Card product with an explicit anti-fraud value proposition.

New ways to pay
In 2022, payment processors went live with global payment methods, allowing African merchants accept international payments from millions more customers from around the world with higher success rates.
For example, Paystack was the first payment processor to launch Apple Pay in Nigeria in 2021 and introduced Apple Pay for businesses in Ghana in 2022. Flutterwave added support for Google Pay, and PayGate partnered with Samsung Pay for digital payments in South Africa. This enablement of borderless payment options also went the other way with social media giant Twitter activating Chipper Cash and Barter as payment methods.
2022 also saw increased adoption of NFC technology for Tap-to-Pay/Tap-to-Phone in different African markets. Interswitch and Providus Bank partnered with Mastercard to launch a new Tap-to-Pay solution in Nigeria, while Network International partnered with Nedbank in South Africa. Zapper and Squad also launched contactless POS solutions in South Africa and Nigeria, respectively. Additionally, Apple opened up its mobile POS technology to select third-party payment providers like Stripe with plans to expand access to the service in the future. Perhaps we might see this come to African countries in the coming years.
Even as the industry leans towards mobile contactless hardware, standalone POS terminals saw notable advancements. Paystack launched Paystack Terminal, an offline payments solution that offers greater customisation and deeper integration with merchant systems, while ZirooPay also raised $11.4 million for its POS device that can operate without an internet connection.

Phone manufacturers and mobile operating systems launched consumer wallets
2022 marked a notable milestone for Google Wallet and Samsung Wallet as they launched in Africa for the first time, in South Africa. With Android OS dominating the African smartphone market and Samsung ranking as the second-largest smartphone brand on the continent, the introduction of these consumer wallet products in Africa is significant.
Transsion, the parent company of Tecno, Infinix, and ITEL, and the market leader in mobile phones across Africa, doubled down on their fintech plans. Tecno and Infinix, in partnership with PalmPay, launched TECNO Wallet and Infinix Wallet in select African countries. Both brands capitalized on PalmPay’s regulated financial layer while leveraging their expansive distribution networks and brand recognition to directly acquire users.
Incumbent consumer apps/wallet-adjacent apps in Nigeria also had their share of interesting moves.
Savings app Piggyvest rebranded Abeg (which started as a P2P payments mobile app) to Pocket, and expanded Pocket’s offerings to include consumer wallet features including a store marketplace, business bank accounts, and virtual cards. As we wrote in Issue 138 of the Decode Fintech newsletter, Pocket (Abeg) presents a compelling opportunity for Piggyvest to capture value from payments that it was leaving on the table.
Savings app Cowrywise launched Sprout to help businesses better handle treasury management. And digital bank Kuda launched in the UK with a remittance product targeting Nigerians in the diaspora.
Digital lenders acquired Microfinance Banks. Buy-Now-Pay-Later and B2B embedded lending solutions also gained traction 
Digital lenders continued to play a crucial role in delivering essential credit solutions to Africans in 2022. 
One significant trend saw digital lenders acquiring or investing in Microfinance Banks (MFBs). Branch, Umba, and Pay Hippo all acquired MFBs in their different markets. As we wrote in Issue 154 of the Decode Fintech newsletter, these acquisitions enable them to potentially reduce capital costs, connect directly to relevant payment infrastructures, obtain regulatory cover, and maybe most importantly, evolve into full-service banks. The credit-led neobank model has already seen success with players like Brazil’s Nubank and Nigeria’s Carbon.
Beyond just advancing cash directly to the everyday borrower, digital lending also evolved into a key business feature in supply chain operations, ecommerce, and ride-hailing. Foodtech startups like Twiga, StockNow, and Glovo, offered supply chain financing to retailers, while embedded lending startup Pezesha partnered with AutoChek, a car marketplace, to connect car buyers to lenders. Autochek also launched its vehicle financing arm, Autochek Financial Services, in late 2022. M-KOPA and Moove raised millions of dollars to expand their vehicle and asset financing solutions to more customers and markets.
Buy-Now-Pay-Later (BNPL) also gained traction in 2022. We already mentioned Weaver Fintech’s acquisition of Pay Just Now, but players like Egypt’s MNT-Halan also launched BNPL solutions for businesses. As inflation rises and incomes stagnate across different African markets, BNPL could potentially gain more adoption as a consumer purchasing option.
Despite these industry highs for digital lenders, some challenges persisted. Later in this piece, we’ll explore the ongoing issues with predatory behaviour, regulation, data privacy, and consumer protection issues around digital lending in markets like Kenya and Nigeria.

New partnerships and pivots emerged in response to crypto’s downturn
The market value of cryptocurrencies took a significant hit from its 2021 highs, leading to a decimation of value and trust among digital asset owners and the bankruptcy of some crypto lending and trading institutions.
The biggest of those blowups was FTX, a crypto exchange and brokerage firm which at its peak, was valued at $32 billion. FTX was an investor in a number of African fintechs, and while most of the African fintech startups it invested in, such as Chipper Cash, Nestcoin, VALR, and Mara, reassured users about the safety of their assets, Nestcoin was heavily affected, resulting in layoffs.
However, it wasn’t all doom and gloom for crypto in Africa. Strategic partnerships and pivots highlighted the potential for cryptocurrency solutions as underlying payment infrastructure. MFS Africa partnered with Ripple for cross-border payments, and App Zone transformed into a blockchain infrastructure company called Zone, focusing on money movement. Both companies already serve as core payment and banking infrastructure for banks, fintechs, and mobile money providers across Africa.
Pick N Pay, a leading South African retailer, extended its pilot of in-store crypto payments. Yellow Card, a leading African crypto exchange, launched Yellow Pay, a crypto payments mobile app. However, consumer adoption of crypto tools may face adoption hurdles as trust remains a challenge.
Regulation, Governance, and Policy
Fintechs acquired new licenses and expanded across Africa
In 2022, new and existing fintech players across various African markets received several licenses to enable geographic expansion and product launches. 
We’ve mentioned Airtel and MTN acquiring Payment Service Bank (PSB) licenses in Nigeria. GTCO and Access Co, the holding companies for Guaranty Trust Bank (GTB) and Access Bank, respectively, obtained approval for Switching and Processing licenses in Nigeria. This enabled GTCO to launch Squad, a payment solution for businesses. Being two of the country's biggest and most successful banks, their foray into payments might impact the payment landscape and inspire similar strategies among their peers. As we wrote in Decode Fintech Issue 134, payments present these banks with a new opportunity in the face of stagnating returns from the core banking business.
Payment processors Paystack and also Flutterwave upgraded to Switching and Processing licenses in Nigeria, allowing them to streamline costs and develop new products. Payments in Nigeria is shaping up to become an even more competitive space with the outcome being a better payment experience for businesses and their customers.

These new licenses should be understood in the context of an aggressive policy push by the Central Bank of Nigeria (CBN) towards more cashless payments. Towards the end of the 2022, the CBN announced a redesign of the N200, N500, and N1000 notes. This was followed shortly by new cash withdrawal limits at banks and ATMs. Although criticized for the short timelines and impact on cash agents and the unbanked population, the CBN’s objective is to promote the adoption of digital payments.
Zooming out of Nigeria, payment companies were successful in applying for licenses in other countries as well. Paystack was granted a Payment Service Provider license by the Central Bank of Kenya (CBK), and Cellulant and MFS Africa received payment licenses from the Central Bank of Uganda.
The Pan-African Payment and Settlement System (PAPSS) began building a payments network to connect African countries
Widening our perspective even further, 2022 saw significant advancements toward establishing a unified African payments network. The Pan-African Payment and Settlement System (PAPSS), a new African cross-border payments network, was launched in January 2022. Led by the African Union (AU) and Africa Export-Import Bank (Afreximbank), PAPSS aims to connect payment systems across various African countries and drive intra-African trade.
Although the initiative was launched in January, the first transaction through PAPSS took place in October 2022 between First Bank of Nigeria and Ghana Commercial Bank. This underscores the complexity of creating a more interconnected Africa. Achieving this goal necessitates a multi-stage, multi-decade approach that includes integrating regional payment infrastructure in numerous countries. For instance, to make that first transaction, PAPSS had to onboard and integrate Nigeria’s NIBSS and Ghana’s GhIPSS into their network. Taking a step back, many African countries don’t yet have a regional (instant) payment system, which highlights the need for further investment in this area.

As we gradually overcome these hurdles, we anticipate a future where PAPSS facilitates a variety of cross-border transactions, weaving African economies together in a seamless, interconnected network. 
African countries took different approaches to crypto regulation
As crypto markets tumbled and companies broke new ground with product developments, African countries adopted different strategies towards the regulation of cryptocurrency activities.
 			Cryptocurrency regulation in AfricaSource: FT Partners
In Southern Africa, countries such as South Africa, Botswana, and Namibia implemented regulations, licensing categories and policies that not only accommodate cryptocurrency usage but also address potential risks to users. This enabled players like Binance and Luno to accept fiat payments in South Africa and allowed Yellow Card to secure a license in Botswana.
The Central Bank of Nigeria launched the eNaira digital currency in October 2021. As of August 2022, over 4 billion Naira worth of eNaira was transacted. Nigeria’s Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) classified crypto as a security and issued regulations that cover the issuance, exchange, and custody of digital assets. Nigeria’s House of Representatives also proposed legalising digital currencies and collaborating with relevant regulators to clarify roles and policies.
The Central African Republic (CAR) made history as the first African country to adopt Bitcoin as a legal tender. This change passed by the country’s parliament made the Central African Republic the second country after El Salvador to formally embrace adoption. The country also proposed Sango Coin, a digital token tied to specific benefits including land ownership. However, implementation faced numerous obstacles, such as the Central African Bank’s prohibition of banks from partnering with cryptocurrency platforms or recognising cryptocurrencies as assets. As a result, the Sango Coin launch was delayed multiple times. Furthermore, the actual adoption of Bitcoin for local payments remained virtually nonexistent, which is expected given the country’s 10% internet penetration.
Despite the varying attitudes towards crypto across the continent, it’s evident that African consumers are turning towards cryptocurrencies and platforms for speculative income, investment protection, and cross-border payments. The various approaches to crypto regulation act as a continental-scale sandbox, allowing other countries to learn from the successes and challenges faced by their neighbours.
Nigeria and Ghana launched regulatory sandboxes
Talking about actual sandboxes, both the Bank of Ghana (BOG) and the Central Bank of Nigeria released updated regulatory frameworks for the operation of sandboxes. The two apex regulators partnered with EMTECH to launch their sandbox programs and have opened up invitations for startups to apply.
Regulatory sandboxes allow startups and established financial institutions to test out new financial products before fully releasing them into the market. As we explain in a recent Decode Fintech article, sandboxes could provide a low-risk alternative for launching financial products in Africa and it’s only a matter of time before more African countries follow suit.
Watch our roundtable discussion with Tunji Odumoboni, Executive Director at Emtech, to explore the impact and challenges of regulatory sandboxes.
Regulators cracked down on predatory lending
As the battle against predatory practices in the lending industry intensified, more regulatory bodies took aggressive action against digital lenders. Many players faced accusations of charging exorbitant interest rates, violating customer privacy, and trapping borrowers in spiraling debt traps.
In recent years, Kenya has led the charge by enacting new laws directed at digital lenders. These policies curb interest rates, require digital lenders to acquire licenses, and restrict the misuse of customer data and credit bureau reporting. The implementation of these policies has been quite strict, with non-compliant lenders facing suspension from credit bureaus and financial institutions. Out of 288 digital credit providers, 10 had been granted licenses by September 2022 by the expiration of a 3-day ultimatum (this number rose to 32 approved digital lenders by March 2023)
In Nigeria, the Federal Competition and Consumer Protection Commission (FCCPC) took a similar path following complaints from customers. The apex body in charge of consumer protection issued new guidelines, shut down offices, and mandated digital lenders to register and obtain approvals.
In both cases, Google played a role in enforcing compliance. Most digital lenders in Africa distribute their mobile apps through Android-enabled smartphones due to their widespread use and user-permitted access to data. Following the crackdown against predatory lenders, Google delisted non-compliant lending apps, supporting the regulators’ efforts.
Mobile money taxes caused a decline in the use of mobile money
In the past decade, the value of mobile money transactions has skyrocketed. As a result, African governments with high debt ratios and dwindling revenue have imposed taxes on mobile money transactions in a bid to generate more revenue.
In 2022, Ghana joined countries like Cameroon, Uganda, Tanzania, Congo Republic, Zimbabwe, Ivory Coast, and Kenya in implementing a levy on electronic transfers, including mobile money transactions. While these direct taxes may offer short-term gains, they often have long-term negative consequences. The impact is often most pronounced among low-income, fee-sensitive individuals who are quick to revert to cash-based payments.
In Ghana, surveys and interviews imply a decline in the number of active agents and agent transaction activity. In Tanzania, peer-to-peer transactions dropped by 38% from 30 million to 18 million per month after the implementation of a mobile money tax in July.
Pushback from customers and institutions seemed to have had some effect. Tanzania repealed its mobile money transactions taxes, and Ghana reduced the e-levy rate to 1%. As more countries struggle with debt repayments and shrinking incomes, it’s crucial for their governments to explore alternative revenue sources beyond taxing financial services.

Egypt and Ethiopia continued to open up their payments markets
As African countries continue to advance financial services, it is worth taking a particular look at Egypt and Ethiopia. Both countries boast sizable populations with limited access to modern payments, credit, and banking services. However, in recent years, regulators in both countries have made significant progress in driving innovation within the financial services sector.
Ethiopia opened up its telecoms and mobile money sectors to private investment, and in 2022, Safaricom commenced operations in Ethiopia. M-Pesa, the telco's mobile money subsidiary, also started preparing to launch with a mobile money license expected in 2023. Chapa, Ethiopia’s first payment gateway for merchants, was launched in the same year. There were other deeper infrastructure breakthroughs. EthSwitch (Ethiopia’s national payment switch) and Ethiopia’s Oromia Bank partnered with Mastercard to enable Mastercard cards to be accepted for the first time in Ethiopia.
Further north, Egypt has made substantial progress in developing its national payments infrastructure with the launch of InstaPay, an instant payments network. On the regulation and policy front, the Central Bank of Egypt (CBE) launched its financial inclusion strategy for 2022-2025 and granted new licenses to Klivr, Telda, and Khazna. The CBE also approved OPay to launch its prepaid card solution.
The result of these policies is increased investments and operator activity. In the first half of 2022, Egyptian fintechs raised $167 million, surpassing the total amount raised in 2021 and nearly tripling the figure for 2020. Vodacom also announced plans to roll out financial services in Egypt, in partnership with Alibaba.
There are a few other noteworthy regulatory developments from 2022. Tense interactions between banks, telcos, and regulators on fees persisted in some countries. In Nigeria, telcos claimed that banks owed them substantial amounts of money in unpaid USSD bills. In Kenya, bank-to-mobile money transfer fees that were initially waived due to COVID were reinstated, leading to pushback from customers and courts. As telcos and banks increasingly compete directly in financial services, the evolution of their relationships will be intriguing to observe. 
Nigeria and Ghana made some progress with their identity initiatives. In Nigeria, mobile subscribers were required to link their SIM cards to their National Identification Number (NIN). Non-compliant lines were barred in April 2022, which led to a loss of subscribers for telcos. Meanwhile, in Ghana, the government introduced the Ghana Card, which linked cardholders’ identities to SIM cards, mobile money, and bank accounts. Despite short-term challenges, these initiatives serve as essential building blocks for a secure and reliable financial system.
The year ahead
As we wrap up our review of the stories and trends that shaped African fintech in 2022, it’s clear that it was a tough year in many ways. Despite that, African fintechs displayed remarkable resilience and adaptability. From mobile money’s growth to the expansion of telcos’ fintech services, to the launch of new payment channels for consumers, fintech in Africa continues to grow.
2023 is off to a strong start, from MNT-Halan’s $400 million fundraise, to FairMoney’s acquisition of PayForce, to the launch of PayShap, South Africa’s instant, interbank payment service.
The Decode Fintech newsletter will be right here, taking note every week on the latest news in African fintech, and helping break down what it all means. We look forward to remaining your trusted guide to African fintech.

Introducing Discount Codes
Boost your sales and reward loyal customers with special discounts and offers
Naman Kamra
Product Manager, 					Paystack
On this page
We’re excited to announce Discount Codes — a new addition to Paystack Commerce, which helps you boost sales and reward loyal customers with special discounts and offers.
Say hello to Discount Codes
Whether it's for a seasonal sale, a product launch, or saying thank you to your customers, discounts are a great way to give your customers the added encouragement they need to buy from you. Here are some ways that business owners like you already use Discount Codes:
Attract new customers by offering discounts on their first order
Increase customer loyalty by offering exclusive discounts to customers who buy often
Boost sales by running promos (such as Mother’s Day, and Valentine's Day promos) and limited-time discounts
Customers are more likely to buy from stores that offer discounts, so we’re excited to place this feature in your hands.
Try Discount Codes
Create exciting discounts to boost your sales and reward loyal customers
Try Discount Codes →
Getting started with Discount Codes
Discount Codes is available to all businesses that use Paystack. To add discounts to a single Product, or to an entire Storefront, simply log into your Paystack Dashboard, go to the Commerce section, and under Products or Storefronts, you’ll find a new 'Discount Codes' tab.
You can use Discount Codes in three ways:
Fixed amount discounts: This method helps you deduct a flat amount from the original total that a customer should have paid. So, a hair wig vendor could give out a $20 flat discount to everyone who spends more than $100 on her store, for instance.
With percentagediscounts, you can discount a desired percentage off your customer’s final bill, and run promos such as 10% off, 50% off clearance sales, and so on.
The final option is delivery fee discounts. This helps you offer free deliveries to customers who meet specific criteria you set. So, you could offer free deliveries only to customers from a certain part of a city, or a country. Or to customers who buy above a certain amount.
Shareable Takeaway
Businesses can now boost sales and reward loyal customers with Paystack Discount Codes
 					Share on WhatsApp 				 					Share on Facebook 				 					Share on Twitter 				
Here are some more exciting things you can do with Discount Codes:
You can set the maximum number of times that a discount code can be used. This helps you run a promo like: 'The first 30 customers who make a purchase will get 100 ZAR off their orders'
You can set the validity period for each discount code. Here’s one way to use this feature: 'everyone who buys this product before July 1 will get 10% off their order'!
You can also set a minimum order amount. With this feature, you could run a promo that goes: 'Every customer who spends up to 1,000 GHS with us gets free delivery on the house!'
Now, let’s say you don’t want a single customer to use Discount Codes more than once. You can set it up such that each customer only gets to use a code once, helping more of your customers enjoy the promo!
Let’s imagine that you want to say sorry or thank you to a customer by offering them a discount on a purchase. With Discount Codes, you can pre-apply a discount to a product, and send them a link to it. When they click on the link, they’ll see the discounted price, not the full amount!
There are so many other fun and effective ways to boost sales with Discount Codes. Once you create a discount code, simply share it with your customers via your usual marketing channels, and watch more sales roll in.

The Central Bank of Nigeria’s Framework for Regulatory Sandbox Operations
What can we learn from other countries that have adopted Sandboxes?
Learn even more about regulatory sandboxes with the Decode Fintech Roundtable
On December 12, 2022, the Central Bank of Nigeria (CBN) published an invitation on its website for interested startups and innovators to apply to its Regulatory Sandbox. The CBN’s Sandbox is being launched in partnership with Emtech - a modern central banking infrastructure provider - and has been anticipated since the publication of the CBN’s Framework for Regulatory Sandbox Operations in January 2021. Startups have until February 1, 2023 to apply to be in the first cohort of the Sandbox.
The purpose of the CBN's Sandbox is to enhance innovation, promote financial inclusion, and ensure consumer protection, while providing a platform for engagement with fintech companies in the payments space. This article explores the requirements, eligibility criteria, and benefits of the CBN’s sandbox, and what it might mean for Nigeria’s fintech ecosystem.
But before we dive into all that, let’s take a step back. What are sandboxes, and why are they so important?
What is a sandbox?
A regulatory sandbox is a test area set up by regulators to allow innovators and startups to try out technologies and innovations, through live experiments under the regulator’s supervision. Regulatory sandboxes have become particularly relevant in the fintech space where there’s a growing need to develop regulatory frameworks for emerging business models. 
The first Regulatory Sandbox for fintechs was created by the UK’s Financial Conduct Authority (FCA) in 2016. Today, more than 60 countries globally including Australia, Germany, Singapore and Brazil have adopted regulatory sandboxes. 
According to a World Bank study, Africa currently has the third highest number of sandboxes worldwide, ahead of North America and South Asia. Countries such as Rwanda, Kenya, Uganda and Sierra Leone have all adopted regulatory sandboxes to drive innovation and financial inclusion. In August, 2022, the Bank of Ghana also announced the launch of its Sandbox in collaboration with Emtech. 

Shareable Takeaway
The Central Bank of Nigeria is inviting interested fintechs to its regulatory sandbox. Successful companies will enjoy close collaboration with the CBN while prepping for launch.

Why are sandboxes important?
Over the years, innovations in technology have changed how money moves. For example, mobile money, machine learning, and biometric IDs have shaped the way we conduct business, and enabled more people to participate in the formal economy. But risk is an inevitable part of innovation, and so regulation and sandboxes provide necessary guardrails. Both innovators and regulators return often to the question 'how do we continue to facilitate innovations, while decreasing consumer’s exposure to risk?' and work collaboratively to find the ideal compromise. 
In essence, regulatory sandboxes are a way to strike a balance between the rapid growth of fintech innovations and the need to mitigate the risks that arise from these emerging business models.
What are some benefits of sandboxes?
Real-time regulatory guidance 
Regulatory sandboxes give fintechs the type of access to the regulator that enables them to gain regulatory guidance in real-time. In a regulatory sandbox, a fintech can access tailored support from regulators as it develops its products and services, and creates a space for discussions that ensure that regulatory actions strike the right balance between fostering innovation and mitigating risks. 
This collaborative approach helps fintechs to navigate complex legal and regulatory requirements and reduces the legal uncertainty that they often face. This open and active dialogue influences the nature of the relationship between regulators and innovative fintechs towards a relationship characterized by mutual learning and trust.
Reduced time-to-market
As fintechs are able to interact with the regulator earlier in the product development cycle, regulators get a chance to identify problems before they become full issues, which prevents fintechs from heading down the wrong path. This collaborative process enables the smooth development of new innovative products and in turn enables these products to get to market sooner.
Enhanced credibility when seeking investments and partnerships
The fact that a startup is testing its innovation in a regulatory sandbox might give it credibility in the market when seeking investment. A report from the UK Financial Conduct Authority shows that sandboxes can facilitate access to finance for startups as the regulatory oversight can provide a degree of reassurance to investors. In the UK, at least 40% of firms which completed testing in the FCA sandbox received investment during or following the sandbox test.
Improved consumer protection
In a sandbox, fintechs can also access the regulator’s expertise to ensure that their products and services contain adequate security measures and privacy features, which benefits end-consumers.
Sandboxes can inform evidence-based law and policy
Sandboxes are a response to an urgent need felt by the regulator to understand emerging technologies. Beyond the innovator receiving first-hand guidance from regulators on their products and solutions, the regulator also gains a better understanding of emerging technologies and their associated risks. Sandboxes therefore present a mutual learning opportunity for the regulator and the innovator.
In a survey conducted by Consultative Group to Assist the Poor (CGAP), 85 percent of the regulator respondents stated that their goal in using sandboxes was to keep up with changes in the market, and to learn about emerging technologies. Sandboxes enable regulators to gain a deeper understanding of the potential uses and risks of a new technology, which can lead to the development of evidence-based regulations. 
In essence, as regulators learn about the opportunities and risks that a particular innovation carries, they are able to revise and shape the regulatory framework and ultimately develop the right regulatory environment to accommodate the innovation. Importantly, regulatory sandboxes signal the openness and willingness of the regulator to evolve with the innovative times.
The Central Bank of Nigeria’s Framework for Regulatory Sandbox Operations
The CBN’s Sandbox aims to encourage fintech innovation, improve access to financial services, and enhance customer experience by improving the delivery of payment services in Nigeria, amongst other goals. We explore the key provisions of the CBN’s Sandbox Framework below.
Who can apply to be in the sandbox?
The CBN has provided two categories of applicants who can apply to participate in the Sandbox.
Existing CBN Licensees - financial institutions and companies licensed by the CBN
Local companies in technology, telecom and other industries, that intend to test an innovative payments product or service. This includes companies that are proposing non-regulated financial products or services using emerging technologies. They are innovators of new solutions involving technology that is not currently covered under existing CBN regulations
Applying to the sandbox is completely optional (it’s not a compulsory regulatory requirement) and is especially helpful for newer startups who are looking for a way to build a relationship with the regulator.
Shareable Takeaway
The deadline for applying to the first cohort of the Central Bank of Nigeria Regulatory Sandbox is February 1, 2023.
 					Share on WhatsApp 				 					Share on Facebook 				 					Share on Twitter 				
How to apply to the Sandbox
Startups can fill out the online application form via the CBN’s registration portal, linked here. Here are the supporting documents required to apply, and startups have until February 1, 2023 to apply to the first cohort of the Sandbox. Applicants can expect to hear back on the status of their approval within 45 to 60 working days after the application closing date.
Approved applications will receive a Letter of Approval (LoA) permitting the applicants to test their innovation when they enter the Sandbox. The CBN’s Sandbox will consist of cohorts which are groups of innovators that gained entry to the sandbox during the same period. The CBN will also continue to engage admitted participants on the scope and duration of the tests, any regulatory flexibilities that participants need, and reporting requirements.
Criteria for acceptance
To qualify for the CBN’s sandbox, products and services must meet certain requirements:
The product must be innovative; it must demonstrate the potential to improve accessibility, customer choices, efficiency, security, and quality in the provision of financial services; or the product must open up new opportunities for financial investments in the Nigerian economy.
The applicant must ensure that the proposed project stays within a limited transaction value and volume for better risk management. 
The applicant must have conducted an adequate assessment of the product, service, or solution to confirm its usefulness and functionality. In addition, the applicant must have identified all associated risks, which should not adversely affect consumer experience.
The applicant must have the necessary resources to support testing in the sandbox. This includes the necessary expertise to mitigate potential risks and losses.
The applicant should have a business plan to show that the product, service or solution can be successfully deployed after exiting the sandbox.
What happens if a startup is successful in the Sandbox?
After completing the sandbox test, the CBN will decide whether the product, service or solution offered by the successful startup should be introduced into the market. For successful applicants, the CBN will provide guidance and support in obtaining operational licenses. This support could be in the form of guidance in filling their applications for a license or advice on the options for addressing identified risk issues, which could reduce the cost of engaging external consultants.
In essence, while successful startups would not receive a license on exiting the sandbox, they would be given a formal approval by the regulator to indicate that they have passed the sandbox requirements. This could be in the form of a Certificate of Completion, Approval-in-Principle (AIP) or other formal document. Possessing this formal approval could also expedite the licensing application process for startups, as they would have received formal backing from the regulator.

FAQs
What can we learn from other countries that have adopted Sandboxes?
As mentioned before, other countries have operated sandboxes over the years. This provides a rich collection of examples from which to learn. What are some approaches that other countries have taken when implementing their sandboxes?
Clear exit requirements
It’s important that sandbox frameworks provide legal clarity on the available exit options for startups in the sandbox. The CBN’s Sandbox Framework is clear on the exit options for successful and unsuccessful sandbox participants. There is however, the gray area of startups that successfully complete the sandbox, but there’s no existing licensing regime for the innovation under the existing regulatory framework.
The approach adopted in Kenya by the Capital Markets Authority of Kenya in cases where a license doesn’t yet exist under the current regulatory framework, is to issue a formal approval which authorizes the startup to carry out temporary operations until an appropriate regulation is adopted.
Access to capital for startups
It's a common misconception that regulatory sandboxes are created to provide funding for startups. It’s important to clarify that unlike startup incubators or accelerators, regulatory sandboxes are created to deliver regulatory outcomes. While there are exceptions where regulators have set up a fund to promote innovation, as is the case in Singapore, this is typically not the norm. While this is not the norm, one cannot deny the importance of access to capital for startups. In essence, how do we graduate startups from sandboxes, with the capacity to go to market if they don't have access to capital? 
To support startups during the sandbox, some central banks have adopted 'private-sector facilitated sandboxes.' This is where a central bank partners with a private sector organization to implement the sandbox. For example, the Bank of Sierra Leone (BSL) launched its Regulatory Sandbox Pilot Program in 2018 in conjunction with the Sierra Leone Fintech Challenge, supported by Financial Sector Deepening Africa (FSD Africa), and the United Nations Capital Development Fund (UNCDF). The Fintech Challenge offered cash prizes and seed capital in addition to the opportunity for admission to the Bank of Sierra Leone’s Sandbox. This partnership with the private sector proved valuable as it helped to mitigate funding constraints for startups participating in the sandbox. 
The CBN’s Sandbox currently does not offer capital to startups, but if it does decide to go down this path in future, that could prompt an increase in applications to the initiative.
Cross-sector collaboration 
It’s important to mention that the CBN’s Regulatory Sandbox is not the only sandbox in Nigeria. In June 2021, the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) released the guidelines for its Regulatory Incubation program. There is also the Financial Services Innovators (FSI) Nigerian Industry Innovation Sandbox which was launched in 2019 with backing from both the Nigeria Inter-Bank Settlement System (NIBSS) and CBN. 
Against this background and given the rapid growth of financial innovation, it’s very likely that startups will create innovations that cut across more than one regulator. These cross-sectoral products create the need for coordination and alignment between regulators. 
In dealing with this challenge, some regulators have adopted a collaborative approach to regulatory testing. For example, the Fintech Supervisory Sandbox (FSS), launched by the Hong Kong Monetary Authority in 2016, collaborated with the Securities and Futures Commission (SFC) and the Insurance Authority (IA) to set up a single point of entry for pilot trials of cross-sector fintech products. The unique feature of this collaboration was that each regulator maintained its own sandbox. In practice, if a startup wanted to test a cross-sector fintech product, it would apply to gain access to the most relevant sandbox. The regulator would then act as a primary contact and liaise with the other regulators, so the startup can access their sandboxes concurrently.
If the CBN were to adopt a similar approach, this would mean that fintechs with innovations that cut across more than one regulator could have access to multiple regulators through a single point of contact. This formal coordination mechanism would also help in coordinating sandbox tests across multiple regulators. This collaborative model has been a significant enabler in the Hong Kong fintech ecosystem. 
Other methods of ensuring regulatory alignment for cross-sector fintech products include joint committees, referral mechanisms, or alignment through memoranda of understanding.

More than a POS
We believe that your point-of-sale (POS) solution should work harder for you.
This is why Terminal integrates seamlessly with your business operations, collects payment however customers choose to pay you, and is infinitely customisable to fit your unique business needs.
If you’re a business owner who cares deeply about creating magical experiences that deepen customer relationships and drive lifetime value, or a developer who is excited to program custom in-person payment experiences, then Terminal has a lot in store for you.
Let’s dive into some of the ways Terminal does more for your business!
Receive payments through multiple channels
Most POS devices accept only card payments. This means that merchants who want to accept payments via alternate methods often end up with manual processes that involve calling a team member outside the store to confirm whether the payment was successful.
With Terminal, customers can pay you via card, bank transfers, and USSD. So if a customer’s bank experiences a card-related downtime, or they’re simply more comfortable with a different payment method, you still get paid.
Easy end-of-day accounting
When many businesses close for the day, they print out a long list of all their POS transactions, and painstakingly check each sale against the money in their bank account. With Paystack, even if you run multiple stores and also accept payments online, you can connect all your Terminals and reconcile your books in only a few clicks.
You also get useful, granular data on each sale made, instead of the typical lump sum reports that other POS solutions send.
Track all payments from your phone
Terminal is part of the Paystack ecosystem, so if you accept payments both online and in-person (even across multiple stores), you can easily monitor all your payments and reconcile your accounts in one central place on the Paystack Dashboard.
This also means that you can monitor your transactions on the go using the Paystack Merchant App for iOS and Android. Download the Paystack Merchant App to get started!
Blazing fast connection
Terminal card readers come with both wifi connectivity as well as a global SIM card. This allows your device to automatically switch to the data signal with the strongest network connection. With Terminal, your staff will process payments faster, and experience much fewer downtimes — shorter queues, happy customers!
Split payments
If you run a company that has several lines of business, Paystack allows you to receive payment and automatically pay different amounts into separate business bank accounts.
For example, a school might want to accept a single card payment and automatically pay a fraction of the payment to the Admissions team, a fraction to the Textbooks team, and a fraction to the Canteen.
Integrate seamlessly with your existing POS systems
Paystack Terminal integrates seamlessly with your existing point-of-sale and inventory management systems. You can get started by using a no-code tool like Zapier, or even by creating an integration of yours via API.
Terminal is both hardware and software
Paystack Terminal is the union of both a high-performing physical device and elegant software. For now, we’re launching Terminal with a single device: the SmartPeak P1000.
But over time, you can expect more hardware options optimised for different use cases. Need a small device that can fit into a pocket, or an unmanned ATM-sized kiosk in a prominent location? Watch this space!
Build custom experiences with Terminal
One of the most exciting things about Terminal is that ambitious teams can build fully custom experiences on top of it. Here are a few examples.
How Burger King boosts sales with a self-serve system powered by Terminal
When Burger King launched in Nigeria, they partnered with Paystack to create the brand’s iconic self-serve 'build your own burger' experience using Terminal. This custom experience ensured that customers could be served more quickly.
Some more examples of how you can use Terminal
Let’s take a look at some other exciting examples of sales-boosting automation you can build for Terminal.
You can build loyalty programs that keep customers coming back with Terminal. Imagine an experience that incentivises repeat purchases by showing customers a countdown to when they can win prizes, or enjoy discounts!
With Terminal, you can monitor changing purchase patterns, so when one of your VIP customers hasn’t shown up for a while, your customer success team can give them a call to re-engage them.
You can update the design and content of your customers’ receipts to reinforce your brand. So, you want to request feedback with a link customised to the customer? Go for it! Or, do you want to show customers a positive message that makes them smile? You can do that too :)
Let’s say you’re raising funds for a cause. With Terminal, one way to do it could be to invite customers to round up their payment to the next hundred Naira. So, say a customer has a bill of ₦7,620, they can choose to pay ₦7,700, with ₦80 going to charity!
Here are even more examples of how to combine multiple tactics to deepen customer engagement, and boost sales!
Make Terminal your secret customer success weapon, and incentivise your sales team to put their best foot forward 👇🏿
Get your customers to keep coming back, and increase their basket size with automated discounts on Terminal 👇🏿
Create self-serve food order stations, and upsell them on bigger ticket orders with Terminal 👇🏿
Terminal is infinitely customisable, and we can’t wait to see what you build!

Building developer tools with OpenAPI
How we think about building developer tools as we scale
Damilola Odujoko
Technical Product Specialist, 					Paystack
On this page
How we started
Deciding on the development stack
Creating our OpenAPI specification
Generating SDKs with OpenAPI Generator
Creating custom templates
Creating configuration files
Benefits of building with OpenAPI
Developers integrate Paystack into their products through APIs or plugins. Over the years, the Developer Relations team, with the help of some amazing contributors, has built a rich catalog of plugins and tools for different platforms.
How do we ensure that we can build more tools as we scale to multiple countries, without losing the bandwidth to maintain the existing tools?
In this article, we share our approach to building the tools that improve developers' experience. If you’re thinking about how to scale your development of developer tools, we hope you find this instructive.
How we started
When we launched our developer documentation in 2020, we provided reference code snippets that demonstrate how our APIs work. The feedback we got made it clear that we could further enhance the usability of these snippets. To solve this problem, we needed to build more developer tools, starting with Software Development Kits (SDKs) for top programming languages.
An SDK is a collection of building blocks for the development of applications. Among other things, SDKs typically consist of functions that help developers achieve specific tasks in their applications.
To ensure that we could maintain each SDK, we needed an approach that would scale as Paystack scales. There were two ways to achieve this goal:
Build SDKs from scratch for each language
Automate the generation of SDKs
Building SDKs from scratch comes with some downsides:
It requires dedicated resources for each language
The initial development of these SDKs is time-consuming - Paystack has over 100 APIs
When our APIs change, we’d need to coordinate the update for each SDK
These downsides could be addressed by putting processes in place, however, that would require significant time and effort. So we decided on the automation approach as it addresses the downsides, and comes with the added benefit of easy maintenance!
Deciding on the development stack
The automation process works because our APIs are RESTful, so we can leverage the properties of the HTTP method.
The properties of each HTTP method show how the SDK will function. The table shows that all POST endpoints will:
Check for the availability of JSON data
Parse JSON data when available
Check for the availability of path parameters
These steps are repetitive, which means they can be represented with templates. Once the templates are created, scripts can be used to generate the necessary SDK functions for all endpoints.
There are several tools that can be used to generate SDKs. These tools require you to present your APIs in a structured format - mostly JSON and YAML. After testing different tools, we decided on the OpenAPI generator. This is an open-source tool that generates clients and server stubs from an OpenAPI specification. We chose the OpenAPI generator because it allows us to provide custom templates that control how our SDKs function.
Creating our OpenAPI specification
 			YAML representation of an OpenAPI specification 		
OpenAPI is an industry standard for designing and documenting APIs. API operations, models, and other components can be defined in JSON or YAML format.
The entry point of the OpenAPI specification is the OpenAPI object which consists of 8 top-level fields:
openapi: This is used to specify the OpenAPI version being used. This is crucial because it tells tools how to parse the specification.
info: This holds the details about your API like version, description etc.
servers: This is where you specify the base URL(s) to access your API. If you have different URLs for your test and live environment, you’ll specify them in this field.
tags: You typically categorize your APIs based on the resources they manipulate. Each category can be listed in the tags object.
paths: The relative paths and operations for each endpoint reside in this field.
components: This holds all reusable objects that can be referenced in different fields of the specification.
security: You can define your API security scheme here. This includes user name and password, OAuth, Bearer token, etc.
externalDocs: This allows you to reference other documentation that accompanies the specification.
An OpenAPI specification is framework-agnostic and its data format makes it human and machine-readable. You can use the OpenAPI specification as documentation for your APIs. Tools can also parse and use the specification to solve different problems. The OpenAPI generator parses the OpenAPI specification, using its fields to generate SDKs.
You can generate the OpenAPI specification directly from your existing codebase if your development stack supports it. Otherwise, the specification has to be created manually. This could be quite tedious. However, one way to go about it is by adding endpoints incrementally. Our OpenAPI specification is open source on GitHub for reference.
Generating SDKs with OpenAPI Generator
The OpenAPI generator is a Java-based tool for generating SDKs from an OpenAPI specification. It supports the generation of clients, servers, and documentation by using:
An OpenAPI specification
A language-specific template
A configuration file
Since we already have an OpenAPI specification, we focused on other components.
Creating custom templates
A template is like a mold for creating exact replicas of an item. Likewise, the OpenAPI generator needs templates to transform the OpenAPI specification into SDKs. The OpenAPI generator ships with default templates, represented as mustache files for each supported language.
The output generated from the default template might suffice, depending on your use case and preference. However, we decided to use the customization feature of the OpenAPI generator, to get a cleaner SDK output.
To customize a template, you begin by extracting the default template to your working directory using the command:
openapi-generator-cli author template -g typescript --library webclient
This command extracts the default typescript template into the current working directory. Once extracted, we could make the necessary modifications based on our preferences. You might benefit from approaching this phase like you’d approach code refactoring. Work in bits, test the outcome, and repeat till you achieve your goal.
Creating configuration files
The configuration file contains the instructions on how the SDK should be generated. The configuration for each language is also baked into the generator by default. Since we had a custom template and wanted to fine-tune some of the generation steps, we overrode the default configuration file.
 			node.yaml: The configuration snippet of the Node SDK 		
The configuration file is a YAML file which means its content is a key-value pair. The key-value pairs are self-descriptive. The inputSpec takes the location of the OpenAPI specification. The templateDir allows us to point to our custom template etc.
With all components now in place, we could generate an SDK with the following command:
npx @openapitools/openapi-generator-cli generate -c ./config/node.yaml
There’s also a command for generating all SDKs at the same time:
npx @openapitools/openapi-generator-cli batch ./config/*.yml
With OpenAPI and the OpenAPI generator, we have a central location for building and maintaining all our SDKs. This saves us time and effort as we make product changes and expand into new regions. That means you can easily access an up-to-date version of our tools.
Benefits of building with OpenAPI
Our OpenAPI specification has opened a lot of opportunities for us in the mid and long term. Some of these benefits are:
Comprehensive documentation of our APIs
Single source of truth for developer tools
Avenue for collaboration with open-source contributors
Ease of maintenance
Automation of repetitive tasks
Delighted developers
Future Explorations
There’s so much to explore with the OpenAPI specification. You can easily manipulate the data format based on your use case. Other explorations of the OpenAPI specification on our radar are:
Fully integrate OpenAPI into our Postman workspace: We recently created our Postman workspace containing our APIs and popular use case collections, all from the OpenAPI specification. Updates to the Postman workspace are currently done manually and we’d like to close the loop by automating the process.
Generate SDKs in top languages: We plan to generate SDKs for other languages, with a focus on PHP, Ruby, Java, and C# next.
Power our API reference with the specification: Since our API reference is a collection of components generated from different data sources, we could replace the data source with the OpenAPI specification.
Power the CLI with the specification: Our CLI currently maintains its copy of JSON data for all endpoints. This can be replaced with the OpenAPI specification to ensure its API lists are always up-to-date.
At Paystack, we’re always on the lookout for ways to improve the developer experience across our products. Developers are already solving difficult problems. Integrating payments tools should not be one more item on that list. With developer tools, integration times can be shortened significantly.

Damilola Odujoko
Technical Product Specialist, 					Paystack
On this page
How to get started
Explore the Paystack APIs
Collections for common use cases
Would you like to contribute to the workspace?
As a developer, it’s valuable to test an API, and to understand its behavior and payloads firsthand. That’s why we’re excited to share our new Postman workspace with you today!
Postman is a platform where developers document, test, and explore APIs. While we’ve always had a Postman collection, our new Postman workspace provides features that allow us improve the API exploration experience for you. These features include:
A comprehensive repository: The workspace allows us to group related APIs and collections easily. This allows you to explore the general Paystack collection and other specific use cases in a single space.
Version control: With the ability to create forks and pull requests (PRs), you can quickly access the latest collections and APIs.
Collaboration: As a developer, you can contribute to the workspace by making a pull request with a modification you made.
The collections in our Postman workspace are generated directly from Paystack’s open-source OpenAPI specification. This makes it easier for us to keep the collection up to date with changes on the Paystack API, which means that you can contribute to the Postman collection by opening PRs on the OpenAPI spec!
Start building in the new Paystack Postman workspace
Test drive the Paystack API and build new payments experiences faster than ever
Explore the Paystack Postman workspace
How to get started
To get started with the Paystack Postman workspace, navigate to the workspace URL in your browser.
If you’re using the Postman desktop app, you can search for Paystack within the search box in the top bar, then select Paystack API from Paystack Developers from the list of results.
The leftmost section of the workspace contains the navigation bar for accessing the various sections of the workspace. Select Collections from the nav bar, which should reveal a list of the collections in the workspace. There’s a general collection for all Paystack APIs and collections for common use cases. The main section of the overview page describes how to use the workspace and its collections.
Once you’ve familiarized yourself with the workspace, you’ll need to set your Paystack test secret key as an environment variable, to test the APIs. You can retrieve your test secret key by visiting your Paystack dashboard. The workspace comes with a default environment called Paystack Test Mode, which in turn has the paystack_secret_key variable. You need to set the value of this variable to your Paystack test secret key by clicking on Environment > Paystack Test Mode and replacing the value. You should also make sure to set the active environment to Paystack Test Mode in the top-right corner.
Explore the Paystack APIs
The Paystack API is a collection of different endpoints to help developers accept and send payments in Africa. To get started, navigate to the Paystack collection, select the Transaction folder and click the Initialize Transaction endpoint. The main pane displays the URL you’ll be calling and the request payload you’ll be passing on the API call. Update the values in the payload using your preferred test values, then hit the send button to make the API call.
At Paystack we use HTTP codes for our responses. We have three categories of response codes. A 2xx response code means your request is successful. A 4xx error means your request parameters aren’t correct - you should confirm that you’re passing the correct parameters. A 5xx error means we couldn't process your request. You should try again or check our status page to ensure that all our APIs are up and running.
Collections for common use cases
On Paystack’s Developer Relations team, we spend a lot of our time supporting developers who are integrating Paystack’s APIs. This gives us the opportunity to learn a lot about the types of applications developers are building.
We’ve realized that there are some common use cases for Paystack’s APIs and that we could better support developers by creating collections for those specific use cases. So far, we’ve created collections for:
Lending
Savings
Memberships
Wallets
Betting
Online marketplaces
If you’d like to add wallet functionality to your application, the 'Create a wallet app' collection contains all the Paystack endpoints you need to achieve your goal. If you can’t find your use case, no worries! We’ll update this list of use cases consistently.
Would you like to contribute to the workspace?
Developers are building amazing products and powering their payments with Paystack. As you interact with the Paystack Postman workspace, we invite you to help us improve the experience in the following ways:
Create more collections - the collections in the workspace are generated from our open-source OpenAPI specification. If you’re familiar with YAML and OpenAPI, you can create a collection and create a pull request. Once merged, it’ll be made available on the workspace.
Report an issue - If you observe any errors (incomplete parameters, typos, or you’d just like to request a collection for your use case) you can help other developers by opening an issue on the OpenAPI repo. This puts the issue on our radar for a resolution.
We look forward to all the amazing payments tools you'll build 💙

How to get FCCPC approval as a Digital Lending business in Nigeria
All the information you need to submit an FCCPC approval application in 2022
Motunrola Bisi-Afolabi
Legal and Regulatory Counsel, 					Paystack
On this page
What types of businesses must comply with this directive?
What does this directive mean for your business?
How do you get approval?
On August 16, 2022, the Federal Competition and Consumer Protection Commission (FCCPC) issued a Limited Interim Regulatory/Registration Framework for Digital Lending in Nigeria. This framework requires digital lending businesses in Nigeria to obtain the FCCPC’s approval within 90 days of the order to be able to continue their operations.
This move by the FCCPC is part of its ongoing investigation into the digital money lending industry concerning reported violations of consumer rights. As part of the FCCPC’s directive, payment companies in Nigeria have been instructed to require all Digital Lending and Consumer Finance businesses on their platforms to obtain this approval within 90 days. 
In this article, we’ll break down what the FCCPC directive might mean for your Digital Lending business, and the steps you need to take to continue to operate without disruption.
What types of businesses must comply with this directive?
The exact wording of the directive is that it applies to Digital Lending and Consumer Finance businesses. If you’re in the business of lending funds, there is a high likelihood that this directive applies to you.
If you’re unclear as to whether the directive applies to your business model, we encourage you to work with your legal team, contact the FCCPC, or reach out to your regulator for clarification.
What does this directive mean for your business?
If you’re a Paystack merchant, you can continue to use Paystack to power payments for your business as of today.
However, as a business that provides digital lending services to customers in Nigeria, you should start the process to obtain the FCCPC’s approval as soon as possible.
Obtaining this approval indicates that your business is compliant with the FCCPC’s framework. This would also enable Paystack to continue to power your payment transactions after the 90-day period.

How NIBSS Instant Payment (NIP) powers Nigeria’s digital economy
NIP is the sixth largest real-time payments system in the world, ahead of the US, and catalyzed the explosive growth of Nigerian fintech innovation. How did this happen?

The big payments opportunity: the rise of new rails
Nigeria’s economy moves at the speed of NIP
Instant digital payment networks support trade and value exchange within and between countries worldwide. In Nigeria, one of those intricate systems is NIBSS Instant Payments (NIP), a payment service used by banks and other financial institutions to power real-time bank transfers for customers and businesses.

NIP processes billions of dollars every day, and is the largest instant payments service in Africa. In fact, annually, NIP processes more transactions than several payment systems in more developed economies. Beyond the sheer volumes that NIP processes, it has also been critical to the growth of financial innovation in Nigeria. 
More and more, the Nigerian economy is moving at ‘NIP-time’ - payments are so fast, they can sometimes be faster than the time it takes to read this sentence. Chances are when transfers between two Nigerian banks happen via USSD, mobile money, or an internet banking portal, the payment is processed by NIP.
In a previous article about MTN’s MoMo PSB, we noted NIP’s critical role in the growth of fintech in Nigeria. In this article, we’ll dive deeper into the rapidly growing instant payments service, exploring its history, how it works, why it matters for digital payments in Nigeria, and why other African countries looking to accelerate their digital economies might want to consider building a similar solution to increase the velocity of money.

Shareable Takeaway
NIP is the largest instant payments service in Africa and top 6 largest in the world, processing more transactions yearly than payment systems in the US.

Need For Speed: Why does NIP matter?
In Nigeria, customers still largely prefer to make payments for low-value in-person transactions with cash. Both the transaction cost to the payer and the settlement time for the payee is usually zero. The time it takes for funds to be available for the recipient to use (settlement time) is particularly important to merchants and customers. This immediacy of value exchange instills a high level of trust in cash-based transactions, and is one of the contributing factors to sustained cash adoption in Nigeria, especially for in-person transactions.
The benefits of cash payments though, usually decline and sometimes disappear when the transaction amounts and distance between transacting parties increases. For domestic remittances and local trade between cities, it can become expensive and even unsafe to move cash, especially in large sums. The settlement time for these kinds of transactions is no longer zero due to the distance and time it takes to move the money.
On a larger financial scale, cash can be a significant burden for central banks and other financial institutions. In 2020, the Central Bank of Nigeria (CBN) reportedly spent ₦58.6 billion (about $141 million) to print cash worth ₦1.1 trillion (~$2.5 billion) in value. This means that as of 2020, the cost of printing naira bank notes represented 5.5% of the total cash value, not including the cost of vans, security personnel, vaults, and other physical infrastructure needed to move and manage that volume of cash.

Digital payment systems looking to disrupt the widespread use of cash have to solve its logistical issues while replicating its benefits. Many electronic payment systems try to solve problems of reliability and cost, but lack the benefit of immediate settlement times. Fast payment systems like NIP bridge this gap by reducing settlement times to near-zero.
The ability of NIP to reliably send and receive money instantly from any bank account at any time has had a significant impact for consumers, businesses, and the Nigerian financial system as a whole.
The instant nature of NIP payments can be very critical for time-sensitive payments like rent, bills, and health emergencies. For millions of Nigerians with low and irregular sources of income, having immediate access to funds after providing a service can be a literal life-saver, especially when loans from friends and family are not readily available.


For businesses, instant NIP payments reduces the amount of working capital needed for daily operations. The faster a business can access revenue from customers, the less it has to rely on cash reserves or interest-bearing credit facilities to pay suppliers. According to ACI Worldwide, NIP helped Nigerian businesses save an estimated $296 million in 2021. This instant availability of funds flows into existing supply chains, increasing the velocity and expanding the surface area of commerce in the economy.

The quicker a business can access revenue, the less it has to rely on reserves or interest-bearing loans to pay vendors. In 2021, NIP helped Nigerian businesses save roughly around $296 million.

Guaranteed instant payments help more customers and businesses trust digital financial services, which leads to greater adoption and a drastic reduction in cash reliance. This directly benefits banks and the government. The NIP trends in the last five years show a steady decline in the average value of an NIP bank transfer, even as volume and value are increasing significantly. This indicates that the use of NIP bank transfers for every day, lower-value transactions is increasing. 
Instant digital money movement makes it possible to build popular, innovative financial products offered by fintechs and banks. Fintech solutions - including savings, investments, insurance, and credit products - embed instant disbursements into their core product offerings, and the promise of instant payouts makes the value proposition of these products a lot more attractive to prospective customers.

A brief history of NIP
Bank transfers in Nigeria were not always as easy or instantaneous as they are today. Before NIP, customers often queued in banking halls, filled out lengthy forms, or presented cheques to send and receive money. 
In 1993, the Nigerian Bankers Committee incorporated NIBSS, and amongst other things, the agency was tasked with centralizing payment and settlement activities among banks and other financial institutions. This involved a manual and time-consuming process of clearing cheque payments and the settlement of positions between banks.
In 2004, NIBSS launched the NIBSS Electronic Fund Transfer (NEFT), an improvement to the existing clearing house system, which allowed for automated and electronic clearing and settlements. It wasn’t the first widely available fund transfer service. Interswitch and eTranzact, launched in 2002 and 2003 respectively, were already working to provide electronic payment services to banks. NEFT was available to all major banks and saw strong adoption, but it still wasn’t real-time, as transfer instructions from customers had to be batched together and processed during limited settlement windows in the day.
The Central Bank of Nigeria (CBN) also provided inter-bank services directly, first through the Central Inter-Bank Funds Transfer Service (CIFTS) and eventually through the Real-Time Gross Settlement System (RTGS). While RTGS provided real-time fund transfer services, it was relatively expensive, and mostly reserved for high-value transactions including settlements between banks.

In 2005, the Central Bank of Nigeria held a recapitalization exercise which had several effects on the Nigerian banking system, including mergers between several banks. A year after this exercise, the CBN, formally appointed NIBSS as the National Central Switch (NCS), and was mandated to connect all CBN-licensed banks, switches, and mobile money operators in Nigeria, and to ensure payment instruments, networks and systems were interoperable. This was a pivotal step towards driving the adoption of cashless payment methods. It would also lay the groundwork for the introduction of NIP.
NIBSS Instant Payments (NIP) was launched in 2011 by NIBSS to electronically facilitate real-time bank transfers. In that same year, the CBN directed all banks to adopt a standardized 10-digit account number format known as Nigeria Uniform Bank Account Number (NUBAN). Up until then, account numbers had varying lengths and formats. This introduction of a standard NUBAN format made it easier to validate electronic payments and routing.
The Central Bank of Nigeria also made it necessary for future categories of financial institutions such as mobile money operators and payment service banks to connect directly to NIP and were interoperable with the rest of the Nigerian financial system.
With NIP, customers had access to an electronic transfer service that could reliably and cheaply perform bank transfers without having to queue in banks.

How does NIP work?
On a fundamental level, a digital payment involves a series of messages, sent securely and electronically through trusted agents, that execute a change in the financial records of two or more parties. A bank transfer is similar to a text message between banks, and less about the movement of bullion vans full of actual cash.
If payments are messages, NIP is a central messaging platform that banks and other financial institutions use to send payments and execute instructions to each other for a fee. Payment systems are designed differently, which explains why not all payments are instant. Once a bank transfer is initiated by a sender, it has to be cleared, then settled irrespective of the payment system. Clearing is the process of sending, reconciling, and confirming payment requests, while settlement is the process of making the funds available to the recipient. 
To appreciate how NIP works requires that one understands the important concept of how money moves between banks.
Most people assume that when someone sends money from Bank A to Bank B, a bullion van full of cash moves from one bank to another. This is not what happens. In reality, what the money movement looks like is that one bank will log a debit in their financial records, while the other bank logs a corresponding credit in their financial records.
In legacy non-instant payment systems, the clearing process (the process of reconciling payment requests) does not happen in real-time. Instead, payment instructions are collated in batches and cleared at particular periods before settlement. These traditional payment systems also require the inter-bank settlement to occur before funds are made available to the recipient. This introduces delays, and as a result, bank transfers through these systems take hours or even days. These delays can vary depending on country and payment type: In Brazil, credit card transactions can take up to 30 days to get settled to the merchant.

Fast payment systems like NIP, however, are designed differently. When a bank transfer is initiated through NIP, the payment request is immediately sent to the recipient’s bank and funds are made available to the recipient almost instantly. In between, several other steps such as confirming the account balance of the sender, and validating the accuracy of the recipient bank account happen very quickly. The settlement step between the banks is deferred to certain periods during the day. For these inter-bank settlements, banks have accounts in the CBN which NIBSS has access to and is able to offset using CBN’s Real-Time Gross Settlement System (RTGS).

By separating the high-level credit-debit instructions away from the inter-bank settlements, NIP can provide an instant payment experience for end-users.
Banks are not the only intermediaries for NIP-enabled bank transfers. Other financial institutions, such as mobile money operators and payment service providers, also leverage NIP to facilitate fund transfers for customers. These non-banks use application programming interfaces (APIs) provided by NIP directly or a commercial bank to perform these bank transfers. In addition, these non-banks have to partner with licensed commercial banks that have accounts with the CBN for the inter-bank step of the settlement process. 
NIBSS also offers an NIP-enabled direct debit service where users can mandate their banks to debit a fixed amount from their bank account at a set time. Although this service is not as widely-used as the bank transfer service, it still sees some significant traction, especially for mobile payments.
Beyond transfers, NIP also provides important ancillary services, including a name enquiry service to confirm recipient bank details and a dispute resolution service for customer disputes. These solutions reduce errors and contribute to the overall efficiency of the NIP service.

Looking at the numbers: Everything, Everywhere, NIP
An analysis of the data on volumes processed by NIP as provided by NIBSS on their publicly available data portal gives us a clear sense of NIP's sheer scale and success; the numbers are staggering, to say the least.
In 2021, ₦272 trillion (~ $650 billion) worth of transfers were processed through NIP, a 72% increase from 2020. This is more than the total amount processed from 2017 to 2019 combined (₦224 trillion).
These numbers have continued to grow in 2022. In the first quarter of the year, NIP processed ₦86 trillion (~$204 billion), more than the amount processed in 2017 and 2018.
The number of NIP transfers tells a similar story of rapid growth. In 2021, 3.4 billion transfers were processed through NIP, a 71% increase from the previous year.

These numbers do not include intra-bank transfers (transfers within the same bank) or transfers through other payment platforms like NEFT or other payment switches. This suggests that the aggregate value of digital payments in Nigeria is much higher. If we compare NIP to other payment channels like NEFT, cheques, and POS, we’ll find that NIP is the dominant channel for payments in Nigeria.

While customers and businesses have directly benefited from NIP’s speed and reliability, banks and other financial institutions (OFIs) have also earned a lot from transfer fees. If we assume a conservative average transfer fee of ₦10, then financial institutions conservatively earned an estimated ₦34 billion (~$81 million) in gross transfer fees from customers in 2021. This figure is likely higher if we account for high-value transfers which incur a higher fee.

Zooming out, NIP is one of the leading instant payment services in the world. Nigeria is also one of the few countries in Africa with a national real-time payments service like NIP. Most African countries without a central real-time payments service have to rely on fintechs or telco-led mobile money operators for instant money movements.

But what is behind this NIP success story?
A combination of speed, affordability, interoperability, and reliability made NIP the preferred channel for digital payments in Nigeria. Policy decisions by the CBN such as the consolidation of banks, the introduction of NUBAN account formats, and the aggressive push towards cashless payments, have also allowed NIP to scale from two banks at the time of launch to almost all banks and digital wallets.
But product superiority and regulatory backing don’t provide a full picture of the rise of digital payments in the last ten years. A couple of larger industry trends and macro-economic drivers further explain this astronomic growth.


Increasing mobile and smartphone penetration
Smartphones and overall mobile penetration in Nigeria have increased in the last decade. At the end of 2010, just before the launch of NIP, Nigeria had 89.3 million mobile subscriptions and a mobile penetration rate of 54%. More than a decade later, there are now over 200 million mobile subscriptions and almost 150 million mobile internet subscriptions in Nigeria.
Banks, fintechs, and now telcos (via payment service banks) have taken advantage of this boom in mobile and internet adoption to grow the use of digital payments. Almost every commercial bank in Nigeria offers a mobile app and internet banking portal for their customers to perform financial services. There are USSD-based banking services available that don’t require an active internet connection. These digital channels, which make it more convenient to engage in financial services, usually leverage NIP for inter-bank transfers.

COVID-driven acceleration of digital payments.
The COVID-19 pandemic led to lockdowns and disrupted global economies, including Nigeria. It however also drove the need for less contact between businesses and their customers, which increased demand for cashless payments. April 2020, the month where Nigeria was in complete lockdown, saw the value of NIP transfers dip to a two-year low of ₦7 trillion. But the months after the lockdown saw volume sharply pick up and continue to rally even after the number of COVID-19 cases reduced.
This trend of COVID-driven increase in cashless payments was not limited to bank transfers. Paystack saw increased merchant signups and customer activity across all payment methods after the April 2020 lockdown, and while businesses have opened up, it appears newly acquired customer preferences for online payments have stuck.

Transformation of business models and payment processes
Many Nigerian industries have leveraged the speed of NIP transfers to significantly improve money movement processes or design entirely new ones.
In the last five years, neobanks and fintechs offering agency banking, digital savings, investments, credit, and other financial services have risen significantly. Users are typically assigned virtual bank accounts to deposit into a wallet, and are also allowed to withdraw funds or send money to other bank accounts. The ability to deposit and disburse in real-time, usually through NIP-enabled providers like Paystack, has gone from being a market differentiator to a basic expectation from consumers.
These advantages are not only available to financial services. Industries like sports betting are leveraging NIP-enabled transfers to provide instant winnings to their customers. Eventually, many more Nigerian businesses will identify points in their workflow that involve money movement, and will implement ways to make this faster through NIP.
The evolution of bank transfers for web payments.
Zooming out, there has been an interesting modification of bank accounts for customer-to-business payments in the last few years. To be clear, customers have always been able to make bank transfers into corporate accounts and this form of payment has become increasingly popular in social commerce and formal retail.
But at very high volumes, bank transfers into a single corporate account introduce tricky reconciliation and payment confirmation challenges. Payment providers like Paystack have been able to design and implement payment experience user interfaces that are similar to debit card payments but actually leverage bank accounts. Customers paying on a website can now pay into temporarily available bank accounts at the point of checkout. Because these payments have to be made in a limited time, the bank transfers are usually performed through NIP-enabled digital channels.

This is a big deal because bank accounts are very ubiquitous in Nigeria. Enabling bank transfers for web payments expands the potential market for eCommerce with a tool that people trust. The Pay with Bank Transfer option on the Paystack Checkout has seen tremendous adoption since its launch.
These factors are some of the key drivers of the adoption of NIP-enabled transfers in Nigeria and we expect this to continue. With the increase in P2P cross-border remittances, we should expect the growth of NIP and overall digital payment volumes to continue.
The big payments opportunity: the rise of new rails
Despite NIP’s dominance, there’s still a wide surface area of payments that NIP doesn’t touch. Additionally, the reliance on NIP by financial services providers presents a concentration risk that becomes apparent in the event of a downtime. NIP downtimes are quite rare but when they do happen, local money transfers between banks and withdrawals from financial products can become critically impacted. 
As mentioned already, NIP is not the only available fund transfer service in Nigeria. There are alternative platforms like Interswitch, eTranzact, and NIBSS-managed NEFT that also process trillions of naira every year. In addition, intra-bank transfers are processed within the bank and don’t usually require an external switching provider.
Fintech disruptors like Pocket (formerly Abeg), FairMoney, OPay, and PalmPay are also building closed-loop multi-sided networks for customers and businesses. These fintechs are working to capture a sizeable percentage of existing payment revenue through improved customer experience and value-added services like savings, lending, insurance, and remittance. Crypto startups are also building new borderless payment rails for money movement, and might rely less on fiat infrastructure in the future.
Despite these alternatives and the potential for aggressive competition, the opportunity for all players is endless. Many customers and businesses still prefer cash and operate outside the ambit of the formal financial system. Onboarding and convincing these users will require investments from multiple stakeholders.
In our last article about the MTN MoMo PSB, we wrote about the network effects of acquiring new users into a payment network. As these customers and businesses are provided with digital financial tools, we should expect even more volumes from NIP and its many alternatives.

Nigeria’s economy moves at the speed of NIP
NIP helped accelerate the growth of digital payments in Nigeria. Customers, businesses, financial institutions, and the Nigerian economy benefit immensely from the availability of instant money movements.
If a country’s pace of financial innovation is directly indexed to the shortest time it takes to move money electronically, then any investment that an African economy makes to accelerate that speed, is worthwhile.
NIP-enabled instant payments are not a silver bullet for creating a cashless economy. There are still complex obstacles to reducing cash usage and introducing more consumers to formal financial services. NIP remains the closest and most successful substitute to cash, and as regulators and operators continue to drive financial inclusion, instant payments will continue to play a big role in that transition to the digital economy, beyond Nigeria and across the continent.
Cash is still king, but if you pause to look carefully, you will notice that the future is already here.

Why send money transfers with Paystack?
How are businesses using Paystack Transfers?
How to use Paystack Transfers
Common Questions
Paystack already helps businesses in South Africa accept payments via cards, EFT, SnapScan, and Masterpass. And starting today, you can now transfer money with Paystack to any South African bank account!
Why send money transfers with Paystack?
We’ve worked closely with several businesses in South Africa to understand their money transfer needs, and provide a solution that’s simple, reliable, and customisable to fit a variety of business models.
We found that businesses typically switch back and forth between Paystack (where they collect online payments) and a separate platform to send money, which is time-consuming and introduces errors. Using transfers on Paystack saves time because you can send money from the same platform where you accept payments.
We also understand that every business is unique, so we made it easy to build custom money transfer experiences via API. This means that no matter how particular or complex your business needs are, you can easily build a solution that gives you fine-grained control over how you send money.
Additionally, Paystack Transfers helps you reduce errors and save time by sending money to multiple bank accounts at once. Instead of sending different sums to different recipients one at a time, you simply upload a spreadsheet of your recipients’ bank details and click Send. It’s very straightforward.
We also made it easy to validate your customers’ bank accounts before sending them money. This reduces the chance of sending money to the wrong recipients. Another reason to validate the identity of the owner of a bank account is that fraudsters sometimes find a way to impersonate your recipients, swapping out the bank account details for their own. Our Validate Account service allows you to confirm the recipient, and this protects you from sending money to bad actors. Learn more about our Validate Account service here.
Finally, you can also use our granular user permissions system to control exactly who can send money out from your Paystack account. This means that while multiple members of your team can have access to your Paystack account to support their work, only you and key members of your team can send money out from your account.
How are businesses using Paystack Transfers?
There are several ways businesses use Paystack Transfers. Here are a few of them:
Businesses that deal with suppliers use Paystack Transfers to quickly and painlessly pay them right from the Paystack Dashboard.
Tech startups use the Transfers API to build beautiful, seamless experiences for their customers. Lending or savings fintechs, for example, are able to build elegant payout flows that send money to customers quickly, and with minimal manual input.
Marketplaces can be difficult businesses to run because as the operator, you’re collecting payments on behalf of the sellers on your platform. Several marketplace operators rely on Paystack to manage payment collections and the automated money transfer to the sellers, using Paystack Transfers via API.
There are several other ways to use Paystack Transfers. And no matter the complexity or flavour of your business needs, you’ll find that our Transfers product supports it.
How to use Paystack Transfers
To use the Transfers feature, you need a Paystack Registered Business. You also need to top up your Paystack Balance before sending out the money.
This guide shows you how to top up your Paystack Balance and transfer money from your Paystack Dashboard →
If you’d like to send bulk money transfers from the Dashboard, this guide shows you how in detail →

The minimum amount you can transfer at a time is ZAR 1, and the maximum amount is ZAR 1,000,000.
How do I top up my balance so I can transfer money?
South Africa-based businesses can only top up their balance using the EFT channel. There is also a 1.0% top-up fee per transaction For South Africa-based businesses.
Are there permissions in place to control who can do a money transfer on my behalf?
Yes. By default, only admin users can authorise a money transfer from your Paystack Dashboard or via API. But you can also extend this permission to other members of your team when it makes sense.
Is the Transfers product available outside South Africa?
Yes, transfers are also available to all Paystack merchants, including Nigeria and Ghana.
Can merchants in South Africa send money to non-South African bank accounts?
No, merchants in South Africa can only send money to South African bank accounts for now.

Money, everywhere you go
On April 11, 2022, the Central Bank of Nigeria granted MTN Nigeria final approval to operate a Payment Service Bank. A little over a month later, Nigeria’s largest telecommunications provider launched its MoMo Payment Service Bank (PSB) to the public, allowing its Nigerian customers create accounts, pay bills, send and receive money, and more - services which have been available to customers in other countries for years.
MTN has a large mobile money business in several other markets across Africa, and is looking to replicate this in Nigeria where its voice and data services are more popular. 
Although this license seems to change things significantly, it’s not without its limitations. In this article, we aim to break down what kinds of services this license allows MTN Nigeria to offer, and why this matters for customers, businesses, and other fintechs.

A brief history of MTN’s financial services
In 1994, only three years after the first GSM call was made in Finland, MTN was founded in South Africa as M-Cell. Upon achieving national success, it expanded across Africa, targeting markets looking to open up their communication industry to private operators.
MTN Nigeria launched in 2001, and in over 20 years, MTN has expanded coverage to most areas of the country, thanks to long term investments in communication, infrastructure, and improving service delivery. It also helped that since its early days, MTN has invested in a network of micro-agents and wholesalers who register customers and sell prepaid airtime, bringing its services close to most communities. 
Today, MTN has over 75 million mobile subscribers in Nigeria and 272 million subscribers across 19 countries in Africa, making MTN the largest telecom operator in Nigeria and one of the biggest operators on the continent.
At the time of MTN’s launch in Nigeria, most African countries had expensive and inadequate banking and payments infrastructure which made it hard for customers to move money around. As more people began to use mobile phones, and more mobile networks reached a large customer base, operators and regulators explored using the existing mobile distribution to provide financial services. 
Mobile phones presented an opportunity to offer customers a 'bank in their pocket,' an easier and affordable way to provide basic financial services like deposits, withdrawals, transfers, bill payments, and credit. Along with a hive of ever-present physical agents, financial services suddenly became within reach.
Before Safaricom popularized telco-led mobile payment in Africa with the launch of M-PESA in 2007, MTN was already exploring ways to provide financial services through mobile phones. In 2005, MTN South Africa partnered with Standard Bank Group to launch MTN Mobile Money, a SIM-based mobile banking service.
The service was branded and distributed by MTN but was a division of Standard Bank Group which provided the actual financial services.

M-PESA’s success in Kenya saw more telcos expand mobile money services into other markets. This included MTN, which began to offer its mobile money service in some of its existing African markets like Cameroon, Ghana, Rwanda, and Uganda. It partnered with banks and regulators, and leveraged its strong brand presence and agents to scale quickly in these markets. 
By 2021, MTN Mobile Money was present in about 15 countries with 56.8M customers completing 10 billion transactions worth about $240 billion.

In Nigeria, however, the journey to replicating this success has been complicated.
Throughout the last decade, the Central Bank of Nigeria made policies to reduce cash usage and strengthen financial inclusion, and in 2014, it introduced the Mobile Money Operator (MMO) license which allowed banks and other financial institutions to provide mobile money services targeted at the financially excluded. Under the rules, MTN was only allowed to provide communication infrastructure, and could neither apply for the license nor offer the services permitted. 
MTN partnered with banks, and one of the more popular partnerships with Diamond Bank (now part of Access Bank) led to the launch of Diamond Y’ello in 2014, a product similar to the 2005 offering with Standard Bank Group in South Africa. By dialing a USSD code, MTN subscribers could open Diamond Y’ello Bank accounts from their mobile phones, and perform basic bank activities such as making transfers, buying airtime, and paying bills. In that same period, many commercial banks started launching their USSD banking service. While MTN and other telcos did benefit from the adoption of these channels, most of the value was captured by the banks. 
Also in 2014, MTN launched XtraTime, a service that allows its prepaid customers to borrow airtime on credit. This product has been very successful, making up a significant portion of MTN’s fintech revenue in Nigeria.
Shareable Takeaway
At the end of 2021, MTN Mobile Money was present in about 15 countries with over 56 million customers completing 10 billion transactions worth about $240 billion in value.

Five years later in 2019, the CBN granted Y’ello Digital Financial Services (YDFS), a subsidiary of MTN, a super-agent license which allowed MTN to partner with other financial institutions to offer MTN customers person-to-person (P2P) cash transfers and bill payments through a network of physical agents. In 2021, MTN Nigeria’s MoMo service added about 374,000 registered MTN MoMo agents and had about 9.4 million customers. By the first quarter of 2022, the number of registered agents had surpassed 800,000, with over 166,000 active agents.

Even with this early success, the super-agent license still had several limitations. For example, the license didn’t give MTN the power to hold customer deposits in digital wallets, and as a result, MTN couldn't provide a wider range of financial services or build a deeper relationship with its customers. 
This is perhaps why this Payment Service Bank license seems to be the long-awaited ticket for telecommunication companies like MTN to offer financial services. But how true is this? 
Timeline of regulation & MTN's attempt at offering financial services
GO DEEPER: A History of Mobile Money in Ghana
In Season 2 of the Decode Fintech Podcast, we explored the history of mobile money in Ghana, one of the fastest growing mobile money markets in Africa. Listen to learn how this happened, and MTN's journey to building one of their most successful financial services product on the continent.
Listen to the episode
What does the PSB license allow MTN to do?
In 2018, the Central Bank of Nigeria introduced new regulatory guidelines for the creation of Payment Service Banks (PSBs) with the goal of driving high-volume, low-value customer deposits, savings, and remittances, particularly in rural under-banked regions. This PSB model was heavily influenced by India’s Payment Banks (PBs) which received global attention following their launch by the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) in 2014. These new banks were expected to drive financial inclusion in underserved regions.
Possibly recognising the inevitable role of mobile network operators in driving its financial inclusion targets, the Central Bank of Nigeria allowed the telcos to apply for the PSB license through subsidiaries. Since 2018, full PSB licenses have been granted to all four subsidiaries of the major mobile network operators in Nigeria (MTN, Glo, 9 Mobile and Airtel). Airtel Nigeria, which was the most recent recipient of the PSB license, also launched its SmartCash PSB on May 20, 2022. 
With the new PSB license, MTN’s MoMo PSB can:
Accept deposits from customers and small businesses
Hold funds in an electronic wallet
Invest in interest-bearing FGN and CBN securities and offer saving products
Engage in different forms of local payments including merchant payments, bill payments, and person-to-person transfers
Provide inbound remittance services
Issue prepaid and debit cards
Provide POS and ATM services
Build a network of physical banking agents for deposits, payments, and withdrawals
According to MTN’s press release of the MoMo PSB launch, 'by dialing *671#, customers can open a MoMo wallet, send money to any phone number in the country and pay their bills.' Given the full scope of activities available to PSB license holders, it's very likely that MTN will provide even more services to customers in the near future.
There are a number of ways MTN can take advantage of its existing brand affinity and distribution capacity to leverage and successfully unlock the full benefits of the PSB license. Let’s look at a few of them.
Accelerate customer acquisition and financial inclusion
According to EfInA, 61% of financially excluded Nigerians have a mobile phone. MTN can drive customer acquisition by leveraging its extensive and growing agent network to bring formal financial services to underserved users in rural and frontier regions. About 35.9% of the Nigerian population still lacks access to financial services, and MTN can provide that critical on-ramp to the financial ecosystem for these users. They can also gain new users by offering electronic wallets as device-agnostic USSD services and mobile applications. It is no surprise that the first version of the MoMo PSB is a USSD service, and is available on every networkas stated in its press release. Moving beyond a closed-system, telco-based mobile money offering to multi-service smartphone apps has always been a key part of MTN's long-term fintech strategy.
Increase the average revenue per user of existing subscribers
Despite being MTN’s largest market in terms of overall revenue, MTN Nigeria’s average revenue per user (ARPU) in the fourth quarter of 2021 stood at only ₦2,088 (~$5), 25% lower than MTN South Africa’s average revenue per user of ZAR97 (~$6.3).
Digital data and fintech revenues increased as users’ behaviours shifted towards the internet and digital services, and voice revenues declined.
Source: MTN's 2021 Financial Statements
The new license can increase MTN’s average revenue per user in two ways: 
MTN can leverage its existing agents to provide financial services to customers and capture most of the revenue for each transaction. As noted in an earlier section of the article, because the super-agent license did not allow MTN to hold funds, MTN could only offer financial services through its agents, and only on behalf of other banks and mobile money operators. This meant that for each transaction a customer did, MTN had to share revenue with other financial institutions. Because the PSB license allows MTN to hold funds in an electronic wallet, this is no longer the case, and MTN doesn’t need to rely on partnering with banks and other financial institutions. 
MTN can potentially up-sell its expanded financial services offerings directly to its millions of subscribers through USSD, SMS, digital marketing, and other forms of promotion. By converting even a small percentage of existing users to active MoMo PSB wallet holders, MTN can earn added revenue from payment fees and gain interest on users’ deposits.
Shareable Takeaway

Facilitate merchant payments & ecommerce
The super-agent license was very limited in its scope as MTN could only provide its customers with bill payment services. With this PSB license, though, MTN digital wallets can become a source of funds for consumer-to-business (C2B) and business-to-business (B2B) merchant payments. 
These payments can be made either through a direct transfer from the MTN MoMo PSB wallet to other wallets and bank accounts, or through a debit card issued to the wallet holder and tied to the user’s funds. 
In the long-term, MTN can build a critical mass of both businesses and customers, and facilitate payments between both parties at almost zero marginal cost. This is a strategy that it has successfully executed in other African countries with $13.3 billion in gross merchandise volume (GMV) paid to about 785,000 active merchants in 2021.

Reduce the cost of airtime distribution 
Since most customers have their funds in physical or digital stores of value that MTN doesn’t control, MTN relies heavily on wholesale agent networks and other financial institutions to distribute airtime to customers. This means that MTN has to incur costs both in managing the scale of operations and paying out to these middlemen. 
By becoming a store of funds itself, MTN users can top up their airtime directly from their digital wallet or relatively cheaper MoMo agents. Today, about 24% of MTN airtime sales in the continent are through MTN mobile money wallets, a number that is expected to rise now that MTN Nigeria has launched its PSB operations. 
Offer remittance services
MoMo PSB is allowed to receive inbound remittances from outside the country into Nigeria, and convert that FX through CBN-authorized channels. Despite high remittance inbounds, Africa still suffers from cross-border money movement challenges which have made remittances beyond and within the continent quite expensive for the average user. Nigeria, in particular, is one of the largest recipients of remittance inflows with over $14.2B remitted in the first three quarters of 2021.
MoMo PSB can make remittances more accessible to their customers, by allowing direct remits into digital wallets, and by leveraging a network of distributed banking agents to reduce the distance traveled to obtain remittances. In the long term, MTN can build a cross-border super-network of its different mobile money services in African markets.

Limitations abound
Despite the possibilities, the PSB license comes with significant restrictions. According to the regulations, MTN’s MoMo PSB cannot:
Directly provide loans or advances
Underwrite insurance
Accept and hold foreign currency deposits
Engage in foreign exchange transactions except for the purpose of inbound remittances
Accept alternative means of value like airtime as a means of payment
In addition to these limitations, 25% of physical activity must take place in rural areas with a high unbanked population as defined by the CBN.

The core business model for many traditional banks involves collecting deposits at low interest from customers and businesses, and using these low-interest deposits to offer higher-interest loans. The net interest income obtained through this usually makes up the bulk of the banking revenue. Because Payment Service Banks can’t offer credit, they’re limited to earning money on fees charged for payments, and interest earned from investing in the Central Bank and Federal Government securities like bonds and treasury bills. These might not be lucrative as most customer payments are low-amount transactions with capped fees, and have low take rates per transaction. In addition, income on investments in CBN and FGN securities are increasingly uncertain as annual average yields have continued to decline in recent years.
In effect, payment service banks will have to process a high amount and velocity of transactions while also figuring out how to offer market-competitive returns on customer savings and deposits.
These limited revenue options combined with the extensive up-front costs required to scale probably contribute to why earlier recipients of the PSB license have gained little traction. It also comes as no surprise that India’s Payments Banks from which Nigeria heavily borrows, are being allowed to seek lending licenses after years of operational losses.
The requirement of having 25% physical activity in rural and frontier regions will also affect MTN’s payment service bank because the local nature of agency banking means that financial success is reliant on the level of economic activity within a particular location. In frontier regions with relatively non-existent digital infrastructure or economic activity, agents and operators are likely to struggle with earning a profit or sustaining operations.
Existing banking models are only viable for 51% of the Nigerian adult population because a significant number of Nigerians still lack power connectivity, cell coverage, and financial infrastructure. This is perhaps why many existing mobile money providers tend to concentrate in urban and semi-rural locations. To drive adoption in frontier regions, MTN might have to use significant interventions like marketing, education, and subsidies.
The implicit limitation on remittances is another restriction MTN will have to navigate. While PSBs are allowed to engage in inbound remittances and sell the foreign currencies from the remittances to authorized dealers, in recent years, the CBN has aggressively put out FX policies to strongly protect the naira against foreign currency devaluations. One of those policies requires FX remittances to customers to be received directly without any intermediate currency conversion. This presents a difficult situation for PSBs as they are not allowed to hold foreign currency deposits.

While it is quite easy to confuse MTN’s MoMo PSB for mobile money, they are actually different categories of financial institutions by law. In the table below, we consider how these limitations and capacities of PSBs compare with Mobile Money Operators (MMOs), Micro-Finance Banks (MFBs) and Super Agents.
Payment Service Banks vs Mobile Money Operators vs Micro-finance Banks
The state of the market
Most of the earlier-mentioned benefits take into account MTN’s strengths in distribution and experience with executing similar strategies in other countries. MTN’s financial services offerings – and mobile money in general – have seen great success in places where there was no existing or sufficient banking infrastructure for providing digital financial services. In many of these mobile money-dominant countries, mobile money was the first reliable, relatively affordable and widely available financial network.
In 2006 in Kenya, only 14-19% of adults had a bank account, and only 26.7% of the entire population had access to formal financial services. The central payments switch was also just developing, and the number of bank branches were not enough to cater to citizens. Most money movements which were largely domestic remittances were through cash mules, and these were not very safe. So when M-PESA launched in 2007, it was both the first mobile money transfer service, and the safest and cheapest alternative available for the entire population.
These conditions, among other things, propelled the mobile money service to the current level of adoption. By 2019, the percentage of adults with access to formal financial services was almost 83%, a trend similar in other MTN markets such as Ghana and Uganda.

Nigeria, however, is different from other countries that have a strong MTN mobile money presence, and a lot has also changed since the CBN first published its first mobile money regulations in 2012. Banking in Nigeria is more advanced and relatively ubiquitous than in many African countries. Many Nigerians, especially in urban areas with the highest levels of transaction activity, have and frequently use bank accounts. 
Investment in IT infrastructure and NIP, the central payments service managed by the Nigerian Inter-Bank Settlements Scheme (NIBSS) has made it super fast, easy, and cheap to do interbank transfers through a mobile phone without stepping into a bank branch. 
NIP has been critical to the rise of digital payments in Nigeria. In 2021, The value of NIP transfers was ₦271 trillion (~ $650 billion), a 72% increase from 2020, and more than the total amount processed from 2017 to 2019 combined (₦224 trillion). In the first two months of 2022 alone, NIP has processed 704 million transactions worth ₦53 trillion (~$127 billion), 51% of the total amount processed in 2019 and 96% of the total amount processed in 2017.
Value of NIP Transactions
In April 2022, Paystack Transfers, which leverages several processors including NIP had a 99.6% transfer success rate and processed 96% of these transfers in less than five minutes. This combination of speed, cost, and reliability of person-to-person transfer infrastructure has propelled trust and adoption.
In a nutshell, the Nigerian digital economy is increasingly moving at the speed of NIP.

NIP has been critical to the rise of digital payments in Nigeria. In 2021, the value of NIP transfers was ₦271 trillion (~ $650 billion), a 72% increase from 2020.

NIP commoditises digital money movement and levels the playing field for all operators. MTN’s MoMo PSB will have to rely on more than just person-to-person transfers to differentiate itself in the market, especially for already banked users.
Beyond person-to-person transfers, commercial banks also dominate other segments of offline and digital banking. According to EfInA 2020 agent banking survey, First Bank’s First Monie was the leading agency banking provider with 37% of all active agents in the country. Other bank players like Access Bank, Zenith Bank, and GTB were not far behind.
The banks have also invested considerably in expanding their digital reach through mobile banking apps and USSD (usually in a delicate partnership with telcos). Today, millions of Nigerian customers and businesses are able to make payments, obtain cards, and apply for credit from their banks through these digital channels.
In addition, non-bank financial institutions are also competing to provide financial services to Nigerians, and the investments have followed: in 2021, the fintech industry received $1.3B in Venture Capital (VC) funding, about 72% of total VC funding for the entire year. Players like OPay, Chipper Cash and Kuda Bank have in turn aggressively invested in marketing and subsidies to rapidly drive growth. This aggressive growth expands to offline services as well: in 2021, OPay had the second most registered agents, and non-banks made up 50% of the top 10 agency banking providers, according to the EfInA agent banking survey. 
The services provided by these disrupting fintechs vary widely, including some services that payment service banks are not allowed to offer: payments, savings, lending, insurance, remittance, investments, micro-pensions, and more. Beyond the breadth of services, users are also being targeted from different layers of distribution. Transsion Holdings is Nigeria’s largest provider of smart and feature phones, and is offering financial services to its base of customers through PalmPay, PalmCredit, and now InfinixWallet and TecnoWallet.
MTN should also expect competition from other telcos as well. Airtel, which launched SmartCash PSB on the same day as MTN’s MoMo’s PSB, also has a sizable base of customers and experience with mobile money in its other African and Asian markets. 
Despite very strong advantages, MTN should expect a very different financial landscape compared to its other African markets.
What does this mean for fintechs?
In the weeks before MTN commenced operations of MoMo PSB, there were mixed reactions across the financial ecosystem. Some fintech industry experts speculated that MTN will 'crush competition from banks and fintechs' while others had tempered or unclear expectations. In reality, this new MoMo PSB entity will likely offer an interesting balance of opportunity for both competition and collaboration in the Nigerian financial industry.
Unavoidably, MTN will attempt to drive aggressive competition. By offering customers an alternative store of value, MTN is looking to capture a sizable portion of existing payment revenues from fintechs. It’ll capture future growth by competing for unbanked users. Combining this with a near peerless distributive muscle and a deep well of resources, MTN is definitely shaping up to be a formidable provider of financial services in Nigeria.
Zooming out though, this might eventually be a net positive for both consumers and competing operators. The overall value of any network increases if more nodes of interaction are added to the network. MTN’s strategy will likely target both already banked users but also the 49.5% of Nigerians that are financially excluded or informally served.

Successfully activating financially excluded users automatically increases the number of people that can transact in the NIP-enabled interoperable payments network. This will result in not just increased revenues for MTN but for other interconnected financial institutions.
For the consumers, increased competition is likely to result in cheaper and better services as MTN and other fintechs will invest heavily in differentiating themselves in the market through better customer experience and a breadth of services.
Beyond just indirect value accretion to the overall ecosystem, there are more direct opportunities for cooperation. We have already established the limitations of the payment service bank license in providing critical financial services like lending and insurance, which are only formally available to less than 10% of the Nigerian population. Many fintechs have the regulatory approval, technical experience, and some level of distribution in providing these services to consumers and businesses. MTN can partner with these financial institutions to navigate the limitations of the payment service bank license, and unlock more opportunities to grow, by providing the following services.
Lending
MoMo PSB could work with banks and other credit providers to offer lending services to their customers. This will likely be through revenue-share agreements where the banks offer the loans to MoMo PSB customers in exchange for a fee or percentage of interest repayments. This allows MTN to increase potential average revenue per user through a higher-margin product like lending while opening partners up to a new customer base. MTN Mobile Money already has this type of lending partnership with banks in other mobile money markets, amounting to a $1.1bn loan book value by the end of 2021. 
Insurance
MTN could partner with insurance companies to offer insurance products to consumers and businesses, who will make premium payments to insurance providers from their MoMo wallets. MTN has seen similar success partnering with leading Insurance providers like Sanlam in other markets. aYo, MTN’s flagship insurance product, registered 16.1m customers in 2021.

Merchant Payments 
Becoming a store of value means that MoMo PSB can facilitate money inflows and outflows from customers’ wallets. For merchant collections, MTN can integrate with PSPs like Paystack to become a payment option on the checkout. This is already possible for merchants and their customers in Ghana who use Paystack. MoMo PSB can also act as a destination for disbursements and merchant settlements and also offer niche services like dedicated virtual accounts for customer payments.

While MTN actually already offers this service directly to merchants through a set of unified mobile money APIs, partnering with other PSPs like Paystack which processes more than 50% of all online transactions in Nigeria, allows it to take advantage of the existing base of merchants to ramp up adoption.
On-ramps and alternative deposit options 
To attract deposits from other bank accounts and wallets, MTN will have to ensure customers have seamless and varied options to fund their MoMo PSB wallets. 
MoMo PSB is required to connect to NIBSS to receive transfers from banks and other mobile money wallets but there are other popular payment methods like cards and QR payments that MTN will likely need to partner with other payment providers for.
Card Issuing 
While the PSB license does allow MTN issue debit and prepaid cards, setting up that product from scratch can be complex and time-consuming. To accelerate time to market MTN can partner with banks, card networks, and issuing startups to easily and quickly offer virtual and physical debit and prepaid cards to its customers. Debit and prepaid cards allows MTN to offer MoMo PSB customers increased options to spend money while also earning revenue from these transactions.
Remittances 
MTN announced plans in their press release to offer remittance services to customers. But as explained earlier, there are regulatory restrictions on both inbound and outbound remittances. MTN can explore partnerships with banks and other licensed money transfer operators to facilitate remittances for MTN customers.
Data and Identity
Subscribers on MTN and other mobile network operators in Nigeria are being mandated by the Federal Government to link their National Identification Numbers (NIN) to their phone numbers. This is one of the biggest government-driven identification initiatives since the SIM registration exercise that started a few years ago. And while both exercises have had some challenges and affected new subscriber signups, it has allowed telcos like MTN to obtain and consolidate customer identity data that can be very valuable to other service providers in the fintech industry. MTN already offers a similar identity service in countries like Zambia but with the MoMo PSB already launched, identity solutions could potentially be explored as well.
This is a non-exhaustive list and the potential for strategic alliances expand beyond even fintech to other areas like supporting ecommerce fulfilment through agent networks and enabling government payments for agricultural subsidies and social schemes. 
MTN is not new to these kinds of partnerships and has worked with different providers both in Nigeria and other African markets to notable success. According to MTN Group’s CEO Ralph Mupita in a recent earnings call, the telco will be looking to 'secure strategic partnerships to support the acceleration of the group fintechs.' Some of these proposed collaborations will require special approvals from regulators and considerations for customer data and risk exposures. If successful, MTN can resolve regulatory bottlenecks and expand revenue beyond the expected PSB model.
Shareable Takeaway
There are several ways in which Momo PSB can partner with fintechs to navigate the limitations of the payment service bank license and provide services such as lending insurance, remittance, and more.

Money, everywhere you go
The PSB license unlocks many opportunities for MTN and allows it to provide financial services to consumers at a scale that it has never done in Nigeria. It does however come with significant regulatory and revenue limitations that will require investments and strategic partnerships to overcome. MTN will be looking to employ capital, expertise, partnerships, and sheer distribution to turn the color of money in Africa’s most populous country into yellow and black.
With competition from banks, fintechs and other telcos, it’s too early to predict definite success but all signs indicate an incoming shift in the financial services landscape.
We hope this article has provided an illuminating lens into the different ways in which MTN might leverage this license to provide financial services. To get more news and analysis about how fintech is evolving in Africa subscribe to the Decode Fintech Newsletter.",blog

Building trust in new markets and other lessons from expanding to South Africa
How Paystack thinks about scaling geographically across Africa as a high growth startup
Joel Bronkowski
Country Lead, South Africa, 					Paystack
On this page
In May 2021, Paystack officially launched in South Africa. Almost exactly one year later, thousands of ambitious businesses across South Africa use Paystack to get paid online. 
The Paystack South Africa team has also grown from a handful of people to over thirty Stacks across engineering, product, customer support, sales, and more, eager to power growth for businesses of all sizes, from early-stage startups, to mature enterprises.


As the year ramps up, you might be thinking of your next steps as a startup, and international expansion might be one of your strategic priorities. How do you identify and prioritize new markets? How can high growth startups build trust with prospective customers in new regions? What are some common missteps to avoid?
As Paystack’s South Africa Country Lead, I’ve spent a fair amount of time thinking through expansion strategy, and in this short article, I aim to distill some of the lessons we’ve learned in the process of serving South African businesses with Paystack’s suite of payment tools.

Design a prioritization framework for new markets
With 54 countries on the continent, we consider several factors when deciding which country to expand to next. Every company’s prioritization framework will be different, influenced by your goals, positioning, product, and more. 
Paystack’s prioritization framework is led by an internal Expansions team, and it includes studying each country’s existing payments landscape, and figuring out whether Paystack’s products can meaningfully serve the unmet needs of businesses who are already accomplishing great things in that market.
In South Africa, for example, we found a growing startup ecosystem (South Africa was top four in funding for startups in Africa in 2021), which excited us because we’ve invested heavily in building a complete API suite that allows startups to build beautiful payments experiences.
We also found a strong and growing ecommerce market (online sales in South Africa grew by 66% from 2019 to 2020) which we were also excited to see because we’ve built a deep bench of business solutions for ecommerce brands, including several plugins for platforms like Shopify, Wix, and BigCommerce, as well as no-code solutions such as Paystack Storefronts for merchants who have simpler needs.
Another factor we consider is how much inbound interest we’ve already received from merchants in that country.
Businesses across Africa can indicate an interest in knowing when Paystack launches in their country by entering their information on this page.

When we looked at the data, we found that many of those responses came from merchants in South Africa. This further strengthened the argument to prioritize South Africa.
Those were some of the signals we weighed heavily in our prioritization framework, and as we continue to expand, our framework will evolve as we gain a better understanding of which signals correlate most strongly with success.
Your own framework might look different, and that’s okay. Start simple. Ask yourself 'What 3 to 5 things must be true in this market for us to have the highest likelihood of success?' and evaluate each country against that rubric. You can evolve your framework as you learn more, but it’s important to document your framework, and evaluate new markets rigorously against that checklist.

Shareable Takeaway
Paystack’s expansion prioritization framework considers several signals, including the maturity of that country’s startup and ecommerce ecosystems.

Actively speak to all stakeholders who might influence your success
Each market is unique, so you need to actively speak to the people and organizations who are already in-market to get a clear picture of the opportunities, and to build trust and meaningful relationships.
We met with several developers, banks, startups, agencies, entrepreneurs, and other knowledgeable folks during our pilot to understand their biggest pain points.

 			Members of the Paystack South Africa team 		
Speaking to prospective merchants gave us a deeper understanding of the needs of different merchant categories. These conversations revealed more about the competitive landscape that desk research alone did not show. We also discovered important ways that we needed to localize our product in order to meet the needs of South African businesses.
Speaking to regulators was also critical. It’s difficult to underscore how important it is to build a relationship with the regulator within your industry, not only to understand the full scope of your responsibilities as a regulated entity, but also to understand the regulator’s vision for the country, so that you can operate in lockstep with them.
And while tools like Zoom and email are extremely efficient, the truth is that the business of building trust often happens in person. Plan to have members of your team on the ground as much as possible to help your prospective partners and customers put a face to a name.
Shareable Takeaway
As you consider expansion, be ready to have a team on the ground to develop relationships with stakeholders such as regulators, partners, and prospective customers.

Be prepared to localize the product to meet local needs
We quickly discovered that we needed to make a few changes to our product to better serve merchants in South Africa. Showing a commitment to providing customers with products that suit their needs is a great way to build trust, and just makes good business sense.
For example, we integrated with popular local payment options like SnapScan. At launch, merchants could accept payments from cards (Visa, Mastercard, American Express), EFT, and Masterpass, but we added Snapscan shortly after, giving our merchants’ customers yet another familiar and potentially more convenient payment option.
 			The Paystack Checkout Form with SnapScan 		
Another localization we made involved Value Added Tax (VAT). VAT exclusive pricing has become the norm for payments in South Africa, but our initial pricing was VAT inclusive, which confused merchants. They assumed we’d charge them VAT on top of our pricing. Eventually, we updated how we handled VAT in line with the common expectation of pricing being VAT exclusive.
Yet another insight was around international payments. We soon realized that our default rules around which merchants could accept international payments were too stringent for South Africa, where the large number of tourists and expatriates means that the average merchant is going to receive a higher than usual number of payments on foreign-issued cards. With this in mind, it’s become a priority to expand the range of global payment methods available to South African merchants to make international payments seamless.

Be ready to build a team on the ground
As we grow in South Africa, it’s become essential to localize operations by hiring on the ground. This is one key thing we’ve learned from engaging with businesses in South Africa: building out your presence with local hires in the new market helps build trust. 
In the early days, internal team members handled different crucial functions such as determining the product pipeline and setting realistic timeframes to drive development, keeping a finger on the pulse of our merchants, and as we mentioned earlier in the article, engaging with banks and regulators. 
Today, we’ve hired team members to fill some of these roles and we’re still on the lookout for more team members to help serve businesses in South Africa. If you’re excited about the challenge of accelerating commerce across the continent, check out these roles with Paystack!

 			The Paystack South Africa team 		
And we’re just getting started
One year after launch, we're excited by our progress and by the further growth ahead. 
In 2021 alone, the amount of revenue that Paystack helped businesses in South Africa collect grew between 35-50% month-on-month, and we're currently doing over 10 times the number of transactions per week than we did last year. But we're just getting started. 
You can expect to see Paystack in more community events over the next few months. Two weeks ago, we were at DevConf 2022 in Johannesburg and Cape Town where we got to meet with and learn from software developers in South Africa. We look forward to meeting with you at future events and learning more about how we can help your business grow.

Building a high-performance campaign page with Airtable as CMS
How we built the Paystack Gift Guide, a marketplace of unique gifts, using Airtable as a content management system

Building the Airtable CMS
Navigating technical challenges in the frontend
Some final notes
Every year since 2018, the Marketing and Design teams at Paystack have worked together to publish a Gift Guide that curates unique gifts made by our creator merchants from all of Africa. 
From leather travel bags made from Namibian antelope hide to hand-woven bògòlanfini cloaks, the Paystack Gift Guide is a careful curation of thoughtful gifts.
The goal of this project is to deepen our relationship with our merchants, and to help them boost sales during peak gifting seasons. Today, the Gift guide is a reusable static website built with HTML, CSS, and Javascript, and deployed using Netlify. We also manage content efficiently on the site via Airtable. This wasn’t always the case.
In this article, we share the design and technical decisions we’ve made in the last few years to improve the Guide and create a delightful shopping experience. 


 			Homepage of the 2021 Paystack Holiday Gift Guide
Iterating towards success 
We made our first-ever Gift Guide to help drive sales for merchants during the Valentine’s Day celebrations in 2018. It was built using Craft CMS, a tool the Marketing team already used to manage content on our blog and website.
 			Homepage of the 2018 Valentine’s Gift Guide 		
This was a natural decision, but not the most efficient one. The Marketing team had to first organise product information from merchants inside Airtable, and then re-upload all that information - product images, product descriptions, pricing, merchant information, and more - to Craft. It was a slow, painful, time-consuming experience.
 			The product overview page for the 2018 Valentine's Gift Guide 		
After the success of the 2018 Valentine’s Gift Guide, we decided that we wanted to re-run the campaign in future. But if we wanted to do more Guides, we needed to make several improvements. 
We needed to increase the website speed, improve site navigation to make it easy for users to discover products, make it a lot easier for the Marketing team to manage products, and more.
Here’s how we did it.

Shareable Takeaway
At Paystack, we optimise for building lightweight websites that load quickly. The 2018 Gift Guide was fast, but future Guides had to be faster. Here's how we did it.
 					Share on WhatsApp 				 					Share on Facebook 				 					Share on Twitter 				
Designing with modularity in mind
We knew we wanted to re-run the Gift Guide campaign several times in future, around different shopping seasons, and so we set out to redesign and re-implement the campaign page in a way that made it a lot easier to republish.
We designed two reusable screens – a product gallery page and a product overview page - with modularity and re-usability in mind. 
Here are some of our low fidelity wireframes and explorations.

 			The first layout 		
This masonry grid approach took inspiration from Pinterest’s wall of beautiful photos. While it provided a beautiful wall of images, it had a few issues. For example, the absence of product names and pricing made it difficult for customers to make quick purchase decisions. Additionally, the masonry approach required a lot more tweaking to ensure that the image was focused directly on the product.

 			The second layout 		
This iteration introduced product names and pricing, which made it easier to make quick purchase decisions, but the filter on the left took up valuable real estate which could have been used to display larger images.

 			The third layout 		
This exploration was an attempt to gain the best of both worlds, but the lack of spacing between images would have required very careful choreography to ensure lighter images next to dark ones.

 			The final layout 		
The final layout gave us maximum flexibility. Product images are large and compelling, the filter is still visible without eating valuable real estate, and it’s a lot easier to skim product details such as the name and price.
After sorting the page layout and information architecture in low-fidelity, we translated the wireframes into high-fidelity designs, using Paystack’s brand elements. We worked closely with the Brand Design team on several elements.


 			The Valentine's Gift Guide Skin 		
 			The December End-of-Year Gift Guide skin 		
The custom hero image can be reskinned to reflect the relevant shopping season. The images above show how the Valentine’s Gift Guide looked different from the end-of-year Gift Guide.

 			Country badges on each product 		
In 2018 when we began the Guide, Paystack only operated in Nigeria. Several years later, we operate in multiple countries, and the Brand team helped create multiple 'stamp' elements to allow us signal that the Guide was a curation of products from all over the continent.

Building the Airtable CMS
Like we mentioned previously, the first Gift Guide was a hardcoded Craft CMS site. While this worked for the first version, the Marketing team shared feedback that copy-pasting the product details from Airtable into Craft was a slog.
What if we didn’t need to move information from Airtable? What if Airtable could serve as both the way we organised product details internally, as well as the CMS for the production site?
We were pleasantly surprised at how easy it was to turn Airtable into a content management system for the Gift Guide. Literally all product information on the Gift Guide page - links, product images, delivery info - is managed from an Airtable base. 

 			Here’s what the product looks like in Airtable… 		
 			…and here’s what it looks like on the page. 		
The Airtable API is very well-documented, and they go the extra mile to make it extremely easy to understand how to integrate with multiple libraries.

 			Airtable takes you to a custom page for each database 		
It’s more secure to make requests to Airtable’s API server-side, because there’s sensitive information like API keys, Base ID, etc. that Airtable requires while making these calls, and exposing this data on the browser makes it easy for third-parties to get access to your Airtable base. To get around this issue, we built a NodeJS middleware that sits between the frontend and Airtable’s API.

Navigating technical challenges in the frontend
As we brought the design to life, we encountered a number of technical challenges that would have prevented us from achieving our goals. Here’s how we solved those problems:
Reducing complexity with a few lines of code 
In addition to helping drive sales for Paystack merchants, the Gift Guide provides valuable real estate with which to acquire new Paystack merchants. We introduced a section educating visitors about Paystack Storefronts, a suite of seller tools that allows creators bring ideas to market, beautifully. This call-to-action module is placed on the third row. 
 			The CTA Module 		
Historically, we’ve used a combination of Flexbox and media query walkarounds to get modules like this to fit across multiple device sizes. While this approach usually works for our web projects, using it for the Gift Guide resulted in a more verbose CSS stylesheet which could become hard to maintain.

We solved these layout issues with CSS grid. With CSS grid, we could achieve the same responsiveness goals with barely five lines of code. More importantly, our users were ready for this upgrade. In February 2018, according to Google Analytics, visitors to our website used older versions of Internet Explorer, Firefox and Opera Mini with no CSS grid support. It made no sense to solve layout problems using CSS grid at the time. By 2021, this had changed significantly.
Shareable Takeaway
When building for Africa, take older browser technology into consideration. Chances are a percentage of your users use older device types.

Grid-row-start and grid-column

.c-gallery__products {
    padding: 3.2rem 0;
    display: grid;
    grid-template-columns: repeat(3, 1fr);
    grid-gap: 2.4rem;
    @media screen and (max-width: 980px) {
      grid-template-columns: repeat(2, 1fr);
    }
    @media screen and (max-width: 600px) {
      grid-template-columns: 1fr;
    }}

.c-gallery__cta {
    border-radius: 2.4rem;
    width: 100%;
    grid-column: 1/-1; // CTA module spans the full width of the third row
    grid-row-start: 3; // CTA appears on 3rd row regardless of vw and count
    display: flex;
    margin-bottom: 8rem;}
Creating the illusion of speed 
When choosing to turn Airtable into the CMS, one of the things we wanted to achieve was seamless content synchronization between the website and the CMS. Changes made to Airtable had to reflect instantly on the website.
To do this on the frontend, we make an API call to Airtable to fetch the latest content every time users visit the page. We put caching logic in place so we only make GET requests to Airtable’s API once every 30 minutes. This prevented us from hitting Airtable's rate limit threshold.
Depending on the users’ internet speed, making this call on the frontend meant waiting a few seconds for a response from Airtable’s API to populate the product list.
At Paystack, we believe that speed is a feature, and the relatively slow page load was a poor experience. We came up with two potential solutions: 
We could hide the webpage behind a preloader and remove the preloader when all the images load successfully on the frontend

Since the site was already lightweight and fast, we could show the already loaded content, but build a custom image preloader
The latter option was more appealing; it displayed the hero content and helped us engage our users while the page was loading. 
We placed three squares on the first row of the product grid, then animated and styled these three boxes, using CSS to create the shimmer effect. This communicated to the user that the image was loading. The image gallery looks like this:
HTML
<div class='c-gallery__products'>
  <div data-loading class='c-gallery__product'>
    <div class='c-gallery__product-image'></div>
  </div>
  <div data-loading class='c-gallery__product'>
    <div class='c-gallery__product-image'></div>
  </div>
  <div data-loading class='c-gallery__product'>
    <div class='c-gallery__product-image'></div>
  </div></div>
CSS
@keyframes imageLoader {
 from {
  transform: translateX(-100%)
 }}

.c-gallery__product-image {
  position: relative;
  width: 100%;
  margin-bottom: 2rem;
  padding-top: 110%;
  background-color: rgba(112, 128, 144, 0.05);
  border-radius: 8px;
  overflow: hidden;}

.c-gallery__product-image::after {
  content: '';
  position: absolute;
  top: 0;
  left: 0;
  z-index: 1;
  width: 100%;
  height: 100%;
  transform: translateX(100%);
  background-image: linear-gradient(-80deg, rgba(255, 255, 255, 0), rgba(255, 255, 255, 0.7), rgba(255, 255, 255, 0));
  animation: imageloader 1s infinite ease-in-out;}
When all images have successfully loaded, we dispatch a productIsReady event and remove the loader elements from the DOM. With a few abstractions, this is what the Javascript looks like:

let animationIndex = 0;

const removeLoaders = () => {
   const loaders = document.querySelectorAll('[data-loading]');
   loaders.forEach(elem => elem.remove());
 };


// Create products from Airtablefetch(FETCH_API_URL)
 .then(res => res.json())
 .then(data => {
    // Format product data and create product DOM element
    return data.map(product => {
      product.isVisible = true;
      createProductElement(product, animationDelayIndex);
      animationDelayIndex += 1; // Delay element, to create the staggered animation effect
      return item;
   });
  })
 .then((productsData) => {
    // Store productsData to help us with sort and filter later

    // Dispatch an event that tells use the products are read
      const event = new Event('productsReady');
      productsContainer.dispatchEvent(event);
   })
  .catch(e => {
    // Handle error
  })
  .finally(removeLoaders);

Improving discoverability
Every time we publish a Gift Guide, we feature a greater number of products. How could we make it easier for visitors to quickly find the perfect gift for the special someone in their life? We invested in sorting and filtering features to make it easier for prospective customers to find the perfect gift.
The first time we built the filter and sort features, we cleared and created new DOM elements every time a user toggled filter or sort. This was far from ideal: we were doing a ridiculous amount of browser painting, making the user re-download the product image every time there was a sort or filter logic. 

 			Sort by delivery on the 2021 Gift Guide 		
Thinking through the solution from a first-principles perspective, our logic needed to do two things in this order:

Remove or hide every product on the page
Show the Product DOM element, in the order we want the items to show
We decided to achieve this using a hybrid of CSS and Javascript. 
We introduced an active CSS class that controlled the stagger entrance of each product card and used CSS to hide non-active elements. Here’s the CSS code:


@keyframes slideIn {
     from {
       opacity: 0;
       transform: translate3d(4rem, 1rem, 0);
     }
   }

   .c-gallery__product:not([data-loading]) {
     opacity: 0;
     display: none;
   }

   .c-gallery__product.active {
     display: unset;
     opacity: unset;
     animation: slideIn .6s $easeOutExpo backwards;
     animation-delay: calc(var(--delay-index) * 40ms);
   }
The Javascript part of the logic involved toggling CSS classes and reassigning CSS variables:

// utils/product-dom.js

export const hideAllProducts = () => {
 document.querySelectorAll('.c-gallery__product').forEach(e => {
   e.classList.remove('active');
   e.style.setProperty('--delay-index', 0);
 });};

export const animateProductIn = ({ id }, animationDelayIndex) => {
 const element = document.querySelector(`[data-id=${id}]`);
 element.style.setProperty('--delay-index', animationDelayIndex);
 const timeout = setTimeout(() => {
   element.classList.add('active');
   clearTimeout(timeout);
 }, 10 * animationDelayIndex);};
The hideAllProducts function is called when users toggle the sort or filter dropdown. This hides all products on the DOM. We then fetch productsData from local storage, sort the JSON using Javascript array methods, and call the animateProductIn function on the loop to make the product card visible again.
Controlling the order in which items showed up on the DOM was another challenge. What’s the point of a sort function, if you don’t have full control over the order in which items appear on a list? 
We solved this by using the CSS order property that comes with CSS Grid. 
Here’s what the final code looks like:

CSS
@keyframes slideIn {
     from {
       opacity: 0;
       transform: translate3d(4rem, 1rem, 0);
     }
   }

   .c-gallery__product:not([data-loading]) {
     opacity: 0;
     display: none;
   }

   .c-gallery__product.active {
     display: unset;
     opacity: unset;
     animation: slideIn .6s cubic-bezier(0.16, 1, 0.3, 1) backwards;
     animation-delay: calc(var(--delay-index) * 40ms);
     order: var(--delay-index);
   }
Javascript
import { hideAllProducts, animateProductIn } from './utils/product-dom';

const sortSelect = document.querySelector('[data-sort]');const productsContainer = document.querySelector('.c-gallery__products');

productsContainer.addEventListener('productsAreReady', () => {
 sortSelect.addEventListener('change', () => {
   hideAllProducts();
   const productsData = JSON.parse(localStorage.getItem('productsData'));
   let animationDelayIndex = 0;
   let sortDirection = 0;

   if (sortSelect.value === 'ascending')  {
     sortDirection = 1;
   } else if (sortSelect.value === 'descending') {
      sortDirection = -1;
   } 

   const handleSort = direction => {
     let productsArray = [];
     if (direction === 0) {
      productsArray = productsData.filter(item => item.isVisible);
     } else {
       productsArray = sortProductByCountryAndPrice(productsData.filter(item => item.isVisible), direction)
     }

     productsArray.forEach(productData => {
           animateProductIn(productData, animationDelayIndex);
           animationDelayIndex += 1;
         })
   };

   handleSort(sortDirection);
 });});
With these problems solved, we shipped the newest version of the Gift Guide in time for Valentine’s Day in 2021, and reused it later in December for the end-of-year holiday shopping season, where we featured 30 unique, thoughtful gifts from Paystack merchants in Ghana, Nigeria, and South Africa.

Some final notes
As a small team of designers who code and care deeply about the user experience, it can be all too easy to spend a very long time attempting to resolve every single technical challenge before shipping. We’re learning to find a healthy balance between craft and speed. Like the saying goes, 'done is better than perfect.'
This campaign, as with several other projects we’ve worked on, showed us that the product is never completely done, and there’s always an opportunity to improve, refine, simplify. 
Ever since we shipped the first Paystack Gift Guide in 2018, we’ve continued to iterate on this campaign page, solving several problems for the business along the way. Most memorably, the experience building the Gift Guide over the last three years was extremely valuable when the product delivery team set out to build Paystack Storefronts, a simple, beautiful no-code seller tool.

To sum it up, here are a few lessons from building and improving the Paystack Gift Guide: 

It’s easy to get attached to and comfortable with tools we’re accustomed to, but sometimes, they might not be well-suited for the problems at hand. First-principles thinking helped us make better decisions. It was how we decided to use Airtable as a content management system, instead of working with two tools

Collaboration is critical. This was a partnership between several design and marketing teams, and we learned that there’s room for different teams to work and learn from each other throughout the building process

Data is your friend. We were able to make incremental product decisions and measure ROI using Google Analytics
We hope this short dive into the behind-the-scenes of the Paystack Gift Guide is helpful if you’re looking into spinning up a marketing page using Airtable as a CMS!

In 2020, we launched Paystack Commerce — a complete toolkit for selling online. A popular request we’ve received since then has been to make it easier for creators to sell digital products like ebooks and digital art with Paystack Storefronts and Product Links.
Today, we’re excited to announce that you can sell your digital products with Paystack, and seamlessly manage the download and post-sales experience right from your Dashboard.
Before now, creators sold their digital products in roundabout ways; usually by redirecting customers to cloud storages or manually emailing files to customers after payment. The new process is automated, simple, and straightforward.
What’s new?
From your customers’ perspectives, this is what buying your digital products now looks like:
Customers will see more information about your product before they buy it, helping them make quick purchase decisions. So, they’ll see photos of your product, the number of pages in your ebook, the length of your song, the file size of your video etc.
 			A screenshot of a Product Link selling an ebook 		
Once they pay, they’ll receive an automated email, with a link to a download page from where they can access your product.
 			A screenshot showing an email sent to a customer, with a link to download the digital product they paid for 		
They’ll also get automatically redirected to the download page, so they can instantly access and download your product.
If there’s an issue with a product they download, they’ll be able to give you quick feedback right from the download page, so you can fix it. If it’s a copyright issue, we’ll receive the claim, and investigate it.

Observability at Paystack: The first five years
Lessons learned from scaling product reliability at Paystack

The future of observability at Paystack
Every day, thousands of businesses across Africa use Paystack to get paid by customers from all over the world. How do we ensure that our systems are able to perform reliably, even as we launch new products and scale into more countries?
The observability engineering team at Paystack plays an important role in this effort. 
We implement tools that allow Stacks to quickly identify and solve problems, often before those issues have a chance to impact our merchants’ revenue. 
In this article, we'll share lessons learned from building out the observability function at Paystack. If you’re an African tech startup thinking about how to improve product reliability while you scale, we hope you find this instructive.
Core principles of observability
The goal of observability is to give better visibility into systems. By examining the external performance of a system, it’s possible to understand that system’s internal state. This gives team members tools to understand how the system behaves, know when and why incidents occur, which helps with fixing those issues, and eventually preventing them from happening in future.

Shareable Takeaway
Observability is the ability to measure the internal state of a system by examining its external performance. It helps teams fix and prevent issues from happening in future.
 					Share on WhatsApp 				 					Share on Facebook 				 					Share on Twitter 				
Observability gives you insight into complex systems
Building distributed systems is hard and scaling can be tricky. How do you combine both while tracking and fixing performance problems? With several moving parts, the chances of failure have increased. This makes it difficult to identify the causes of failure. Observability teams put systems in place to be able to monitor not only for known issues but also to be able to discover unforeseen problems. 
The three pillars of observability
Observability requires insights into logs, metrics, and traces. When combined, these pillars make a system observable to the highest degree. Using only one or two of the three will provide only part of the information you need to find out why and when an incident occurred. So it's important to build an observability stack that incorporates the three.
What are logs, metrics, and traces?
Logs: A log is a text record produced by a system. It provides insights into how the output of a system changes. By sending logs in a uniform way, for example, in JSON, you can query and analyze the logs by the keys and values you expose. This makes it quicker and more efficient when you need to use them, especially during incidents. At Paystack, we use logs to troubleshoot for distributed tracing, anomaly detection, and alerting.
Metrics: A metric is a numeric value that provides insights into the characteristics of a system. Metrics are measurements aggregated over a period of time. They can observe the historical performance of your system to identify any patterns. The 'four golden signals' are good examples of metrics to monitor - throughput (a measure of the volume of requests received by a system), latency (a measure of request duration), error rate (a measure of request failure), and saturation (a measure of how a system's resources are utilized). You can learn more about the four golden signals here. Setting these up gives you fair coverage of your system's performance.
Traces: Traces help track the lifecycle of requests. At Paystack, we have multiple applications that work together to handle merchant requests. Tracking the requests between services helps us understand how our systems behave.
Ideally, your tooling should provide a unified view of logs, metrics, and traces. This eliminates context switching between different tools and makes it easier to understand and solve problems faster.

Shareable Takeaway
Logs, metrics, and traces are considered the three pillars of observability because when combined, they make a system observable to the highest degree.

The early days of observability at Paystack
Before the observability team was officially formed in 2020, monitoring was a broad function of the infrastructure team. Today, observability is a specialized function within the infrastructure team, but at the time — late 2018 through to 2019 — there were three DevOps engineers on the infrastructure team at Paystack who also took on observability functions.
Broadly, the infrastructure team at Paystack ensures that the core systems on top of which product engineers build are robust and reliable. The team also handles critical regulatory and compliance updates, builds internal tools for better service delivery, and ensures the security of all Paystack assets.
One of the infrastructure team’s early goals was to make Paystack's systems more observable, and monitoring tasks formed a key part of these goals. As the team responded to incidents, we took the insights we gleaned and implemented them to improve monitoring.
We were largely successful in monitoring Paystack's systems, but there were a few limitations. First, we realized that a team of three people could not effectively monitor all the services built by 15 other engineers.
It became clear that although the infrastructure team had context on the infrastructure our services lived on, we did not have enough context on the services themselves. This meant that every time there was an incident, we had to escalate to another engineering team who would then solve the problem. This was not the most efficient way to solve problems quickly for our merchants. It was contrary to a widely-acknowledged monitoring rule which states that when someone is paged about an incident, they must have the context and access to resolve it.
The ideal solution was for the engineers to get the alerts and resolve incidents immediately, so we onboarded the engineering teams to PagerDuty, an incident management platform that standardizes the process of responding to problems. It provides the teams with notifications, automatic escalations, and other functionality to help quickly detect and fix problems. PagerDuty helped with escalating incidents to the appropriate teams. This reduced the time it took to find and resolve incidents.

The orange bar shows how the percentage of alerts coming to the infrastructure team has reduced since more engineering teams were onboarded to take on monitoring tasks. 

Forming the observability team
Observability engineering as a stand-alone role is fairly new around the world. Previously, it was normal for DevOps teams to absorb the function, carrying out monitoring and observability tasks with other DevOps priorities, like we did at Paystack. As large-scale tech companies prioritize observability, however, observability is becoming more of a specialized function.
At Paystack, the observability team emerged as we worked on different initiatives to make our systems observable. The engineers who make up the observability team at Paystack are DevOps engineers on the infrastructure team who had been working on observability before the official observability team was created.
The main functions of the team include:
Building and managing the observability framework
Championing an observability culture within the company
Supporting engineering teams with triaging and resolving incidents
Supporting engineering teams with observability needs
Looking into adopting new technology to proffer new solutions as Paystack grows
The observability role requires that the team understands how systems work in order to help other teams monitor effectively. We help product engineering teams integrate their services into the observability pipeline so that we can observe how our systems behave and how they interact with each other, which helps us define what a normal environment should look like, and what may be considered an anomaly within an environment. We also support non-engineering teams, such as the key accounts and the user operations team, with information that helps them support merchants. 

A checklist of skills to look out for in setting up your observability team
At Paystack, we had the advantage of seeding the observability team from members of the infrastructure team. At the time, we looked for engineers who understood how systems worked, had a willingness to try out new tools, and a drive to make things work.
If you’re setting up an observability function from scratch, however, here are a few more things you can consider looking out for. These are qualities we care about at Paystack, which inform the hiring considerations when recruiting for the team:
A background in DevOps, platform engineering, site reliability engineering, systems administration, or software development
An ability to configure and maintain monitoring and observability tools
Previous experience building custom dashboards from multiple data sources
Excellent monitoring, debugging, and troubleshooting skills
Empathetic listening skills and a desire to continuously improve and grow
Ability to understand and articulate what key metrics are important to measure, visualize, and alert on
Willingness to take ownership and creation of new alerting, monitoring policies, and procedures
Knowledge of alert aggregation and incident management tools like PagerDuty

Paystack’s observability stack
One of the observability team's first tasks was to update our tooling. We use a combination of tools to implement observability at Paystack.
PagerDuty
We use PagerDuty for incident response and escalation. PagerDuty’s reliability ensures that no incident goes unnoticed. When it comes to incident response management tools, PagerDuty is considered an industry standard. It also helps that it is affordable and fits into our goals, so choosing it was practical for us. 

 			A graph of our usage and incident metrics in early 2019 		
Datadog
We use Datadog, a monitoring and analytics tool to track performance metrics. Datadog helped move us from depending on default metrics from a previous tool to defining our custom metrics.
With Datadog, we’re working towards a unified view that allows us to monitor the different parts of our services and infrastructure in a central location, and reduces the amount of time it takes for engineers to switch tools when trying to understand and investigate issues relating to the systems they build.
We’d earlier considered using open-source tools, but at the time, we didn't find one that was suitable enough for our use. Managed observability platforms require less maintenance, and because the observability team at Paystack is a small team, choosing Datadog was a practical decision.
Amazon Cloudwatch
We use Amazon Cloudwatch, the default monitoring tool for our cloud provider, AWS, for infrastructure monitoring, and logging. It’s affordable, easy to integrate, and helpful with some signals, especially infrastructure. 
Amazon Cloudwatch has graphs which makes it easy to look at a resource on the dashboard, and then look at its logs and metrics, without having to switch to a different tool. Cloudwatch also provides signals (logs, metrics, and events) from our AWS resources. 
Loggly
We use Loggly for logging and alerting. 
With Loggly’s search and indexing features, we’re able to find answers to questions. We started using Loggly in late 2015 (before our public launch) because it was easy to work with and was intuitive for our application logging needs. We used it as a way to aggregate and easily search through console messages generated by the application while running in production. 
Loggly helps us make sense of our application logs. We can search, visualize, and create alerts. We find this useful because it’s important for the product engineering teams to have a painless experience when troubleshooting. 


Choosing an observability tool
There are several tools required to make observability effective. Here are a few factors we consider when choosing our observability tools:
Tools that are flexible such that we can add context to our application requests
Tools that allow us to automate our workflows
Tools that provide additional visibility into our services and can help with troubleshooting
Tools with flexible and transparent pricing
Tools with machine learning to detect anomalies in our services. i.e. the 'unknown unknowns'
When choosing an observability tool, it's important to look out for tools that are flexible so that you can add context to application requests, allowing you to automate your workflows, and providing additional visibility into your services.
You must also answer the question 'What do my users care about and what do I need to do to become reliable to them?' and choose tools that allow you to adequately measure those metrics.

Building a culture of observability
While the observability team holds up the torch for the function at Paystack, it’s important for all product engineering teams to be observability-minded to ensure that the products they’re working on are available and reliable. 
To improve reliability across Paystack, we needed to bring other engineering teams on board to own parts of the process, and to improve the health of their systems. To instill this culture of ownership, and empower engineering teams with the knowledge required, we organized training sessions where we:
shared how to use observability tools to monitor and resolve incidents
shared how to interpret incidents and alerts from PagerDuty
ran incident response drills
We also came up with a responsibility matrix that showed who was responsible for which parts of the monitoring process and then built monitoring schedules around that. The responsibility matrix we use at Paystack is based on the RASCI model. It defines:
who is responsible
who is accountable
who supports
who is consulted
who is informed
This matrix helped (and still helps) us quickly determine which metrics should be assigned to which teams.
Beyond taking charge of their on-call schedules, reviewing alerts and responding to incidents, engineers are also required to instrument their code and set up dashboards during the development phase, so that their services can send out observability signals (metrics, logs, and traces) and so that performance can be tracked visibly once deployed to production.
As engineering teams take up ownership of their monitoring functions, the observability team is able to invest more time in improving processes and tooling.

Shareable Takeaway
Observability relies on a culture of software ownership. Engineers at Paystack are responsible for the code they ship, and for improving the quality of their systems.
 					Share on WhatsApp 				 					Share on Facebook 				 					Share on Twitter 				
Observability metrics
As we noted earlier in the article, the observability team is responsible for making the process of responding to incidents seamless. To do this, metrics on incident response are critical and influence the team's goals and day-to-day tasks. Here are the incident response performance metrics we track at Paystack:
Mean time to detect (MTTD) measures how long it takes us to be aware of an issue with any of our systems
Mean time to acknowledge (MTTA) measures how long it takes engineers who are on-call to respond to incidents. This is closely related to MTTD because an incident is not considered 'detected' if it has not been acknowledged
Mean time to resolve (MTTR) measures how long it takes to resolve or mitigate issues with our systems by following our incident response process and implementing a fix as needed
The MTTR is the most important metric here because the longer it takes us to resolve an incident, the longer merchants are unable to process their payments.
It's important to note that an issue might not be completely fixed immediately. What's most important for the incident response process is that the incident has been mitigated, the service is back up and the long-term fixes can be implemented after our merchants are happy.

 			This shows the percentage change in incident metrics in early 2019 		
The future of observability at Paystack
We've come a long way in improving observability at Paystack and making our systems more reliable.
It's not uncommon for engineering teams to build applications and only set up observability and monitoring after these applications are in production, and sometimes only after incidents occur, but at Paystack we’ve found that an investment in observability systems has been invaluable as we scale our products and launch in more countries.
There’s still more to achieve. 
We want to create tools that are more accessible to non-engineering teams, empowering them to more quickly understand and solve merchant issues. The future of observability at Paystack is in this ability to provide more context, and in making that information more accessible to all members of the company. We're particularly excited about incorporating automations into incident diagnosis and remediation. This will further help us respond quickly to incidents, and ultimately improve our mean time to resolve.
We hope this behind-the-scenes view has been helpful in understanding how we maintain high levels of reliability for the thousands of businesses who rely on Paystack. We also hope that our experience has provided some guidance on how to build an observability function at your tech startup.
To sum it up, here are a few things to keep in mind if you’re setting up an observability function at your company:
Choose observability tools that fit your business goals
Prioritize observability during the development stage of your products
Define metrics and implement them before services are deployed to production
Observability teams should simplify and automate the process of onboarding tools to the observability pipeline
Involve engineers to take part in the observability and monitoring process
Empower teams across the company by creating tools that help them resolve customer issues

What are Triggers and Actions?
Say hello to the new Triggers
We added new Actions too

Get started with these Zapier templates
Have questions?
Two years ago, we announced our integration with Zapier, an automation tool that helps you connect Paystack to over 3,000 apps, including Mailchimp, Slack, Xero, GMail, Google Sheets, and more.
Today, we're excited to announce 20 new Triggers and Actions that will help you create smarter workflows between your Paystack account and the business tools you rely on.
What are Triggers and Actions?
Zapier lets you create automated instructions, such as: 'when this happens (Trigger), do one or more of these things (Actions).'
Here are a few practical examples:
If a new customer pays through Paystack (Trigger), add them to my Mailchimp account (1st Action), and send them an automated Welcome email (2nd Action).
If a customer abandons a transaction (Trigger), send an automated message to a dedicated Slack channel (Action), so my Support team can quickly follow up with the customer.
Say hello to the new Triggers
In addition to our two existing triggers — New Transactions and New Customer — we've added 10 more:
Abandoned Transaction: This triggers an action when a customer abandons a transaction.
New Order: This triggers when a customer places an order from a Paystack Storefront or Product Link, our free tools for selling online.
New Refund: This trigger kicks in when a member of your team refunds a customer.
New Chargeback: This triggers an action when customers make a chargeback claim against your business.
New Invoice: This triggers when an invoice is newly created or an existing invoice is paid.
New Payment Page Transaction: This trigger kicks in when a customer pays via a specific Paystack Payment Page.
Subscription Renewal: This triggers an action when a customer's subscription renewal succeeds or fails.
New Subscription: This trigger is for when a subscription is newly created.
Cancelled Subscription: This trigger is for when you or a customer cancels their existing subscription.
New Transfer - This triggers an action when a new transfer is queued, or when an existing transfer succeeds or fails.
We added new Actions too
We added 10 new Actions, including four Create Actions, and six Search Actions that help you create smarter automations.
Here are the new Create Actions, which help you automate actions:
Create Refund: Refund an amount that a customer paid to your business.
Create Subscription: Subscribe a customer to an existing plan.
Send Simple Invoice: Send a Paystack Invoice to an existing customer.
Update Order: Update the status of a customer's order, cancel or mark it as delivered.
Here are the new Search Actions, which find requested information, and make them available to be used in subsequent Actions. Please note that all the customer details returned are the details of your existing customers. All that these Actions do is return information that you already possess as a merchant.
Get Customer Totals: This Action determines the number of times a customer has paid to your business, and what the total amount is, grouped by currency.
Resolve Account Number: This Action finds the full name attached to a Nigerian bank account number.
Find Customer: When you pass the email address of one of your customers, this Action returns details from your customer database such as first name, last name, phone number, and their transaction history with your business.
Find Order: This Action finds all the details associated with an order, such as the names, quantity, and cost of items ordered, the customer's email, shipping information, and more.
Find Transfer: This Action pulls transfer details, such as the status of the transfer, amount, and recipient details.
Find Transaction: This action pulls transaction details, such as customer name, amount, transaction ID, and more from a transaction's reference ID.

You can create an almost endless number of automations with the Paystack Zapier integration. Here are detailed video tutorials of three examples to show you what's possible.

Do you host paid webinars? This demo will show you how to automatically give access to only paid customers once they pay for a ticket. We used Livestorm, a popular webinar platform, for this demo, but you can follow these steps for other webinar tools, such as Zoom, as well.
How to automatically send an invoice to customers when their subscription renewal fails
When a customer's subscription renewal fails for any reason, such as insufficient funds on their payment card, this integration helps you send them an automatic invoice, so they can pay using another method.
How to automatically email digital goods to customers after they pay
Say you sell digital goods, such as an ebook, or digital photos. Using this integration, you can set up a workflow that automatically sends the digital goods to customers immediately after they pay.
Get started with these Zapier templates
Are you new to Zapier, but curious to check it out? Here are nine ready-built templates you can immediately use to automate some of your business processes, using sales and customer data from your Paystack transactions.
Add new Paystack customers as subscribers on Mailchimp
Carry out reconciliation by recording new Paystack transactions as sales in Wave
Send an invoice to customers when their subscription renewals fail
Send pending chargebacks to a dedicated Slack channel
Record an invoice as paid on Wave when a customer pays their Paystack invoice
Automatically sign a customer up for a Livestorm webinar after they pay via a Paystack Payment Page
Enrol customers in a Teachable course after successful payments
Send a payable invoice to customers' email addresses when you add their details as a row on a Google Sheets spreadsheet
Create a paid invoice in Xero when a customer completes a Paystack transaction

We're excited to announce Artwork, the video show about the business side of being a creator in Africa 🎉
My name is Toba, Media Associate at Paystack and also host of Artwork!
Last year, Paystack launched a suite of new Commerce tools to help African creators and SMEs bring ideas to market, beautifully. As we spoke with our community, we realised that while there are lots of resources about the craft side of creative work, there are fewer resources to help creators become more business savvy.
Whether it's understanding your IP rights or the factors to consider before setting and increasing your rates, there are very few resources targeted at helping African creators thrive commercially.
At Paystack, we have the opportunity to connect with and learn from the most ambitious teams across Africa. This includes creators who care about their craft and are keenly aware of the need to build out the business side of their creative practice. Artwork lets us share everything we're learning with you.
You won't find this gist in any textbook
In this first season of Artwork, we'll be speaking with creators from Nigeria and Ghana who work across several creative fields, including music, writing, brand design, and photography. They share what has worked for them across topics like marketing, pricing, client communications, building community, and more.
Each 10-minute episode is packed with takeaways that you can immediately begin to apply in your creative practice.
Shareable Takeaway
Paystack has launched Artwork, a video show about the business side of being a creator in Africa. Watch the first episode here → paystack.com/youtube

Live conversations after each episode
Each episode is just the beginning of the conversation. A week after each episode is published, you can look forward to a live, hour-long Twitter Spaces conversation on the Paystack Twitter account where you can learn more from our guests, and get answers to all your questions.
Watch the first episode!
The first episode of Artwork focuses on music distribution and rights management.
Episode one: Distribution and IP rights management — Ria Boss
Rights management is one of those things you would rather not think about. It can seem complex and confusing, but it's an important way to reach new audiences and make sure you're fairly compensated for the use of your music. This is why Ria Boss wants every musician and songwriter to pay attention to it.
Ria Boss is a Ghanaian singer, songwriter, and producer whose song, 'Intro' off her EP Bornday, was recently featured on Michaela Coel's hit HBO TV show, I May Destroy You. After releasing 11 EPs in 11 weeks in 2018, it's no wonder that Ria has a nuanced understanding of why rights management and music distribution matter.
In this episode of Artwork, she breaks down everything from how to negotiate the use of your music for a major TV show, to how to use tools like ASCAP, Tunecore, and Spotify for Artists to track and distribute your music.
Are there topics you'd like to learn about? Or someone you'd like to learn from?
Are there questions you want answered about the business side of being a creator in Africa? Is there an African creator you admire and would like to hear from? Please go ahead and let me know at artwork@paystack.com!

Paystack Storefronts and Product Links are free seller tools that allow merchants in Africa bring products to market, beautifully. Thousands of customers shop through these tools, and we're excited to announce an enhancement that will increase sales even further for merchants.
We're thrilled to announce Pay for Me — when customers shop on your Paystack Storefront or Product Link, they can now get someone else to pay for the order on their behalf.

How to create a Pay for Me link
Here's a short walkthrough on how to create a Pay for Me link on a Paystack Storefront or Product Link.
Once you've created your Pay for Me link, share it with your friends and fans on WhatsApp, Twitter, Instagram, or any other place you interact with them online. Someone might just tap on 'Pay.'
Designed with privacy in mind
When designing Pay for Me, we were careful to ensure that only the minimum amount of information is shared between buyer and recipient.
When a buyer clicks on a Pay for Me link, they'll only see the recipient's name and the details of the products they're about to pay for. Other information such as the recipient's delivery address will be kept private - only the seller will have access to it.
Similarly, when a buyer makes the payment, only their name and email address will be shared with the order recipient.

Improvements to Subscriptions
Smarter tools to manage and boost your subscriptions business
Timothy Nkenu
Product Manager, 					Paystack
On this page
Subscribers can now replace the cards tied to their Subscriptions
Expiring card notifications
New Subscription statuses
New subscriptions management tools and improved Dashboard navigation
Improved notifications control
[Workshop] An introduction to Paystack Subscriptions
Have questions?
Paystack Subscriptions helps you automatically collect payments from your customers at set intervals (weekly, monthly, annually, etc.) without the customer manually entering their card details every time they pay you.
In the past few months, we've made several improvements to the Subscriptions product. Here's what's new.
Subscribers can now replace the cards tied to their Subscriptions
Previously, once a subscription was created, there was no way for your subscribers to change the debit or credit card tied to that subscription, even after the card expired.
Your subscribers can now change their cards from a self-serve Subscriptions Preferences page. Here's more info on helping a subscriber update their card.
Expiring card notifications
On the first day of every month, you'll now receive an email and a webhook event containing a list of all customers whose cards will expire that month. You can also filter your list of subscribers on the Dashboard to track customers whose cards will expire soon.
If your subscriber has a card on file that's about to expire, we'll send them an email alerting them of this. These emails contain a link from where they can replace their about-to-expire cards.
Additionally, from your Paystack Dashboard, you can always manually trigger an email to subscribers that allows them update their card details.
New Subscription statuses
Before now, we had only two subscription statuses — Completed and Active. Now we're adding four new ones, which will go live on Wednesday, November 3, 2021.
Here are the two existing subscription statuses:
Active: All active subscriptions (including renewing, non-renewing, and those that require attention).
Completed: A subscription is marked as 'Complete' when a subscriber has made the maximum number of recurring payments you set for the subscription plan.
Here are the four new statuses we're adding:
Active (non-renewing): A subscription is marked as 'Active (non-renewing)' if the current cycle has been paid for, but the subscriber has cancelled their subscription, and so will not be charged in the future.
Active (renewing): These are active subscriptions that will be renewed.
Cancelled: These are subscriptions that have been cancelled by you or your subscribers. The subscribers will not be charged in the future.
Attention: This status is used for subscriptions that we're unable to charge for any reason, such as when a card has expired, or because the customer has insufficient funds in their bank account.
[Important] If you use the Subscriptions API, you might need to update your Paystack integration. This is to ensure that your subscriptions-related payment flows continue to work correctly after the new statuses are added on November 3.
NOTE: You won't need to do anything if you only use our Subscriptions product via our no-code tools like Payment Pages.
Here's the developer documentation detailing the new Subscriptions statuses that will be added to the API.
[Workshop] Walkthrough of new Subscription Statuses
Join our online technical workshop to speak with the Paystack Integrations team about the new Subscription statuses, and get all your questions answered about how to update your integration.
Date: Thursday, October 14
Time: 5 pm (WAT)

New subscriptions management tools and improved Dashboard navigation
We've significantly improved the Subscriptions experience on the Dashboard to do two things:
Help you make better decisions by giving you more useful information per subscription
Help you find information more quickly by introducing powerful filters, and redesigning the Subscription interface
Here's what's new:
We've created a new section of the Dashboard called Recurring to help you find all your subscription tools and information in one place — Subscribers, Plans, and a brand new page called Subscriptions
 			A section of the Dashboard showing the new RECURRING section, and an overview of the Subscriptions search filter 		
The new Subscriptions page gives you a good overview of your subscriptions at a glance. You can now also quickly resolve issues, such as expiring customer cards, and customers having insufficient balance in their cards.
When you click on a subscription, you also see detailed and brand new information, such as customers' card expiry dates, the last 4 digits of their cards, the next charge date, and much more!
The Subscribers page has also been redesigned to be more intuitive and to provide more information per subscriber.
 			Brand new Subscribers landing page 		
 			This is what you see when you click on a Subscriber 		
Now, you can see a list of all your subscribers in one place, export subscription data from one or more subscribers, filter the list smartly (by lifetime value, plans they're subscribed to, etc), and lots more.
The new Plans page provides overview information like how many people are subscribed to each Plan, and how much you've made from each Plan.
 			New Plans landing page 		
We also updated the design of the individual Plans pages to display a lot more information.
Improved notifications control
The Preferences section on the Dashboard now gives you more control over the notifications you and your subscribers receive about their subscriptions.
[Workshop] An introduction to Paystack Subscriptions
We're hosting an online workshop to show you all the different ways you can use Paystack to power a subscriptions business, and earn recurring revenue.
Join our Subscriptions team where they'll walk your through our recurring billing product suite end to end.
Date: Thursday, October 21
Time: 5 pm (WAT)

Have questions?
Guaranteed recurring payments can be an incredible business model, and we look forward to seeing what you build with Paystack Subscriptions.
There are a lot more improvements to come, but in the meantime, sign up for our workshop, and send us an email at hello@paystack.com if you have any questions at all. We're happy to help.",blog

Common questions
[Replay] Technical Workshop: How to integrate Apple Pay
Your business to the world 🚀
We're excited to announce Pay with Apple Pay — a new payment channel that lets you accept international payments quickly and securely from millions of Apple Pay users.
About Apple Pay
Apple Pay is a mobile payment and digital wallet service by Apple. It enables frictionless payments that allow customers to authorise payments with Touch ID or Face ID, instead of manually filling out long payment forms.
Businesses have long been able to accept international card payments with Paystack, but this integration allows Nigerian and Ghanaian businesses to access millions of Apple Pay users in the 60+ countries where Apple Pay is supported, including the USA, UK, and Canada. In Nigeria and Ghana, Paystack is the first payment gateway to support Apple Pay.
Why we're excited about Pay with Apple Pay
You'll see improved success rates for international transactions
Your customers will be able to checkout in seconds
You'll automatically improve your business' reach, and collect payments via a fast, easy, and secure method that's native to millions of Apple users across the world. All at no extra cost to you or your customers.
How does Pay with Apple Pay work?
From your customers' point of view:
Many international customers have Apple Pay enabled on their Apple devices. If they do, they'll automatically see the option to checkout using Apple Pay, and can complete the transaction using Touch ID, or Face ID.
 			This is what Pay with Apple Pay looks like to customers in Nigeria 		
 			This is what Pay with Apple Pay looks like to customers in Ghana 		
From your perspective as a Paystack merchant:
Pay with Apple Pay is available to Nigeria and Ghana-based Paystack merchants, allowing you to accept payments from millions of customers from all over the world.
Since only your international customers can pay with Apple Pay, confirm that you've enabled international transactions for your business here →
On the same page, kindly ensure that the Apple Pay box is checked to enable the payment channel.
 			A screenshot of the Paystack Settings Page 		
If you only accept payments via Paystack Commerce tools (such as Paystack Storefronts, and Invoices) you don't need to do anything else — you're all set.
If you accept payments via a custom Paystack integration on your website or your mobile app, you'll need to register your domain, as per Apple's rules. It's straightforward, and here's a guide to show you how →
Once these steps are carried out, you'll be able to accept international payments via Apple Pay.
Here's a detailed guide on how to enable Pay with Apple Pay for your business →
Common questions
In what countries is Pay with Apple Pay available?
Pay with Apple Pay is available to Paystack merchants in Nigeria and Ghana, and we’re aiming to bring it to all our markets soon.
Is Apple Pay automatically enabled for my business?
No, it’s not. Apple requires you to manually opt-in, so if you'd like to get paid via Apple Pay, check to see if you've enabled international transactions, and then manually activate Apple Pay from the Preferences tab of the Settings page.
Here's how to enable international transactions →
Here's how to enable Pay with Apple Pay →
 			A screenshot of the Paystack Settings Page 		
After enabling Pay with Apple Pay, what else do I need to do?
If you accept payments via Paystack Commerce tools — Storefronts, Product Links, or Invoices — you won't need to do anything else. Once you enable 'Pay with Apple Pay' on your Dashboard, you're good to go!
If you accept payments directly from your website or mobile app using a custom Paystack integration, you'll need to do a quick additional setup — registering your domain. Here are detailed instructions to guide you. It's a straightforward process, and you'll be done in a few minutes.
How much does Paystack charge for Apple Pay transactions?
We charge the same amount we charge for international transactions:
In Nigeria: 3.9% + NGN 100 per transaction
In Ghana: 1.95% per transaction
Learn more about our Pricing.
[Replay] Technical Workshop: How to integrate Apple Pay
Watch a recording of our live, step-by-step guide on how to integrate Pay with Apple Pay. Most businesses don’t require a technical integration, so this online workshop is optimised for software developers who are integrating Pay with Apple Pay into a mobile or web app.
You can also check out the Paystack Developer Documentation for more information on how to integrate Apple Pay.
Your business to the world 🚀
We're excited to see how Pay with Apple Pay boosts your international sales. Your international customers will immediately recognise the Apple Pay brand on your website, they’ll love the simplicity and convenience; and you'll love the increased sales and conversions.

Can customers make recurring payments through the SnapScan channel?

How much does Paystack charge for Pay with SnapScan transactions?

Paystack is now the preferred payments partner for WooCommerce in Africa
Accepting payments with Paystack on your WooCommerce store is now a lot easier

Why WooCommerce?
How to get started with WooCommerce + Paystack
WordPress + Paystack
In Summary
WooCommerce is the biggest ecommerce solution in Africa, and we’re excited to announce our official partnership which makes Paystack the preferred payments partner for WooCommerce in Africa.
Here’s what this partnership means for you: Paystack is now integrated more closely into the WooCommerce experience, and so to accept payments on your store, you can now simply select Paystack as your payment option right from your WooCommerce Dashboard.
Previously, you needed to separately download and install the Paystack plugin for WooCommerce, but integrating Paystack is now a lot simpler.
Why WooCommerce?
WooCommerce is arguably the most popular ecommerce solution in Africa. Here are some of the reasons why many business owners and developers love it:
Scalability: Irrespective of the size of your business, you can use WooCommerce. And as your business grows and becomes more sophisticated, you can trust WooCommerce to scale as you scale.
Pricing: WooCommerce is one of the most affordable ecommerce platforms out there. By itself, it’s completely free. You only pay when you install extra plugins to your store for added functionality. Even then, many of the plugins are also reasonably priced.
Extensibility: There’s a large community built around WooCommerce, so chances are that no matter your business needs, there’s a plugin — free or paid — that can solve it for you.
Useful analytics: WooCommerce comes with extensive and intuitive analytics that help you better understand how your customers interact with your brand.
How to get started with WooCommerce + Paystack
Setting up a WooCommerce store, and accepting online payments on your store is easy. Here’s a detailed guide (and video) that shows you how to get started with WooCommerce and Paystack.

We’ve also partnered with some of our friends at 4 digital agencies — Semantica, Woww, Yobo and Gen6 — to help you set up your WooCommerce store for a fee. If you have more sophisticated business needs, or you simply want professionals to help you set up, they can reliably help you out.
Digital Agency? Let's talk!
If you're building interesting solutions for your clients, we'd love to explore a partnership with you.

WordPress + Paystack
WooCommerce is one out of many WordPress tools. We also help businesses get paid on several other specialised WordPress tools, such as: Gravity Forms, WP Give, Paid Membership Pro, WHMCS, Easy Digital Downloads, Engine Themes, and more!
In Summary
We're excited to solidify our partnership with WordPress, making it a lot easier for merchants and developers of all sizes to sell with WooCommerce, and accept payments online in Africa.
If you have any question at all about WooCommerce, don't hesitate to reach out to us here. We're happy to help!",blog

The Decode Fintech Podcast allows us to hit record and share what we're learning.
In the first season of the podcast, which you can listen to here, we featured guests from American Express, GTBank and Paga, who had interesting insights to share. At its peak, the season was the 4th most popular podcast (business category) in Nigeria on Apple Podcasts, and also the 3rd most popular podcast (entrepreneurship category) in Ghana. We're excited about Season 2, and we hope you love it too.
Voices from across Africa
In this season of the show, we switched things up and expanded our conversations to span the continent, discussing everything from the history of mobile money in Ghana, to best practices for international expansion, to the future of cryptocurrencies on the continent, and more.
We also tested out a narrative style where we featured multiple perspectives on one subject. We think you'll enjoy this new style.

We're kicking off Season 2 with one episode, and subsequently, you can look forward to a weekly release schedule for the rest of the season.
Episode 1: A History of Mobile Money in Ghana
The season's pilot episode takes us to Ghana, the fastest growing mobile money market in Africa. We explore what it took for Ghana to earn that title. Among the many guests who help break it down for us are Archie Hesse, CEO of Ghana Interbank Payment and Settlement Systems (GhIPSS), and Bruno Akpaka, the first General Manager of MTN Mobile Money in Ghana.
Look out for even more exciting conversations
Season 2 was all about mining insights from the best in the business. Here's what each episode looks like:
Episode 2: International Expansion 101 for Fintechs in Africa
What should you know before expanding your Africa-based fintech to more countries?
In this episode, we explore the art and science of launching financial service products beyond your home country, covering everything from how to choose which countries to expand into, to how to hire in different markets, and what to watch out for when incorporating the business.
Our guides through this topic are operators with long experience in expansion: Wiza Jakalasi (Chipper Cash), Marcello Schermer (Yoco), Adia Sowho (ex-Migo), and Maria Rotilu (ex-Branch).
Episode 3: How Paystack Drives Growth with Customer Service
Customer service goes beyond just answering emails and phone calls. When managed correctly, every interaction with customers can generate key insights that help grow your business.

In this episode, Steve Amaza, a Customer Success Manager for User Operations at Paystack, speaks about how Paystack uses customer service data to improve the product, the tooling that the team uses to keep up even as the company scales, and the value of empathy and a problem-solving mindset in building a world-class customer support team.
Episode 4: How expressPay Builds Trust with Customer Service

As a fintech company, you work hard to ensure that nothing goes wrong. But when things do go wrong, like they occasionally will, how you handle the situation can make the difference between a customer who churns, and a passionate ambassador for life. In this episode, we speak with Francis Appiah, the Operations Manager at expressPay.
Francis speaks about hiring great support teams, and how a diverse support team leverages past experiences, skills and relationships to go above and beyond when solving customer problems. He also discusses how to balance providing great customer service to even the most difficult customers, while protecting team welfare.

We recently launched Paystack Storefront — a free and complete toolkit for selling products online, beautifully. Curious about what a fully set-up Storefront looks like? Glad you asked 😄
Say hello to the Paystack Popup Shop!
To build great Commerce products, we needed to become merchants ourselves
We had lots of fun building Storefront. So much so that we got curious about stepping into our merchants' shoes for a bit...
So we made a merch store featuring 7 beautiful products, that we designed and fabricated across 5 countries, over 15 months, in partnership with several African brands.
As you explore the Popup Shop, you'll see multiple commerce tools in action, including product variants, minimum order limits, WhatsApp chat, Gift Orders, and more.

This was a learning exercise for us. It gave us a better sense of the needs of makers and merchants, and gave us a crash course in global supply chains and international freight. Let's just say that, while making software is hard, we learned that there is a LOT of complexity in translating digital bits into physical atoms 😅
For makers who provide physical goods and services, we salute you! 🙌🏿🔥
Treat yourself and a loved one to a thoughtful gift
Here are the bespoke products you will find in the Popup Shop

🕯 Energise your space with Brave Scented Candle and Reed Diffuser

Every order supports Mentally Aware Nigeria Initiative
Mentally Aware Nigeria Initiative (MANI) is arguably Nigeria’s largest youth-run and youth-focused mental health organisation. Their work has never been more necessary, and we're proud to partner with them, and have the Paystack Popup Shop double as a fundraiser for the important work they do. We'll be donating up to 15% of all sales of select items on the Popup Shop to MANI.
Thank you
It's been such an instructive experience fabricating our own products, and we'd like to say a huge thank you to the brands who partnered with us to bring these products to life. Our most sincere thanks go to Boriah Clothiers, COL Fragrances, Grapes Pattern Bank, Printex Ghana, Turban Tempest, and Zivanora.
We also hope you enjoy these products as much as we enjoyed making them.
Finally, as the year winds to a close and thoughts turn to gift-giving, please try and support the many African makers and brands who are giving it their best, despite everything, every day.",blog

What's the difference between Product Links and Storefront?
All the tools you need to bring your ideas to life
How to create a Storefront
Common questions
LIVE WORKSHOP: How to set up your Storefront
Sell more online
Earlier this year, we announced our Paystack Commerce initiative and introduced Product Links, a simple way to sell one product online, beautifully.
Today, we're excited to announce our latest and most powerful Commerce tool yet — Paystack Storefront, a free and complete seller toolkit for selling multiple products online.
What's the difference between Product Links and Storefront?
Product Links are great if you want to sell one single product at a time. You can add product photos and videos, create variants, and more.
But what if you want a full-blown online store where you can sell multiple products at a time?
That's where Storefront comes in. With Storefront, you can set up simple seller pages through which you can sell multiple products at a time.
Say hello to Paystack Storefront
Paystack Storefront is a free and complete seller toolkit for selling all your products online beautifully.
Explore Storefront →
All the tools you need to bring your ideas to life
We've spoken to numerous African creators over the last few months since launching Product Links. We learned a lot, and their insight influenced the design and development of Storefront.
Build trust by linking to your other online properties
One way that customers determine the legitimacy of online retailers is to check out their various social media handles. For example, a business that has comments enabled and engages with customers is a very good sign. A verified account is even better.
This is why Paystack Storefront makes it easy to share details about your business and prominently share links to your social media handles. These are important trust markers that increase conversion.
Chat with your customers on WhatsApp
Sometimes, customers have clarifying questions they would like to ask at the point of purchase. Without an easy way to reach out, they're likely to churn. With this in mind, Paystack Storefront comes with a handy 'Contact seller' button right on the purchase page. By giving your customers the chance to contact you via WhatsApp, email, or a phone call right when they're on the purchase page, you'll reduce churn and increase sales.
Increase sales with Gift Orders
Many businesses say that gift orders are a strong driver of their growth. But we also heard from merchants that a surprising number of customers who buy gifts for others actually forget to inform the recipient. In low-trust environments, that can result in some very awkward encounters.
Paystack Storefront makes it trivially easy for customers to purchase gifts for others, and to give them a heads-up to expect the order, which makes delivery a lot easier.
Simple, powerful inventory management
Paystack Storefront comes with several tools to help you stay on top of your inventory.
List and sell products with multiple variants (such as a T-shirt that comes in different sizes or colours)
Set a custom stock quantity threshold, so that when you're in danger of running out of stock, an automatic low stock alert reminds you to restock
Control how many units of a product a customer can purchase at a time with minimum / maximum order limits
Keep track of sales with the Paystack Merchant app
Customize your Storefront
Beauty matters. The most successful creators know that how a product is presented can matter as much as the product itself. This is why we go the extra mile to create a highly polished purchase experience your customers will love.
Said plainly, we work hard to make sure that products sold through Paystack Storefront look really, really good, which creates a strong brand perception and allows creators to charge a premium.
Also, creators can also customize Storefront with their brand colours, customize the storefront URL, and add product photos, videos, and GIFs to further excite prospective customers.
Leverage the Paystack brand to sell more
Many customers say they're more likely to purchase from merchants who accept payments with Paystack. This is why Storefront keeps the Paystack brand visible throughout the sales experience to increase trust, and increase the likelihood of closing sales.
Get started for free
Like all features on the Paystack Dashboard, Storefront is available for free to creators. No set-up fee. No recurring subscription. You only pay the small payment processing fee.
And like all Paystack features, we're constantly improving Storefront and all our other Commerce tools. Check out our Commerce Roadmap to see what's coming down the pipeline.

Introducing Multiple Variants and Inventory Management Improvements to Product Links

Common Questions
More info?
We're excited to introduce Multiple Variants to Product Links, as well as a ton of other improvements to how you manage your inventory on Paystack.
A Paystack Product Link is a simple, high converting page for selling single products beautifully. Let's dive into the new features.
Sell multiple variants of the same product
Imagine you're selling the same t-shirt in three different sizes (small, medium, and large), or in different colours (red, yellow, or green). Previously, you would have had to generate separate Product Links for each variant.
With the new Multiple Variants feature, you can simply create one product, and then define all the available variants of that product. This saves you a lot of time and provides a much smoother purchase experience for your customers.
Learn how to set up multiple variants for your products.
Get alerts when your stock is low
The new Low Stock Alert feature automatically lets you know when you're in danger of running out of stock.
You can specify the quantity level at which you want to receive an alert. Once the number of units you have in stock meets or falls below that number of units, we'll alert you via email to top up your inventory.

Learn how to set a low stock alert for your products.
Let customers buy gifts for others
Just in time for end of year sales: customers can now more easily purchase your products as gifts for others.
Previously, a customer who wanted to purchase a product as a gift might have had to enter a lot of instructions in the delivery notes section. Now, they can proactively signal that the order is a gift, and enter the contact and delivery details of the gift recipient.
When this happens, we'll send the paying customer a receipt, and the buyer can choose to inform the recipient to expect a delivery from you.
This feature is available automatically on all Product Links, and you don't need to do anything to enable it.
Set a minimum or maximum order limit
The Min/Max Order Limit feature lets you control how many units of a product a customer can buy at a time. It's useful in a number of situations, for example:
Say you sell event tickets, and you don't want hoarders to buy in bulk and resell later. With Order Limit, you can set a maximum limit of, say, two tickets per purchase.
Or say you only make a profit when customers buy at least three units of an item. With Order Limit, you can set the minimum order limit to three so that prospective customers must purchase at least that number of items.
Here's a tutorial that shows you how to set up your preferred Min/Max Order Limit.
Sell more online with Product Links
Paystack Product Links are the fast, simple, beautiful way to sell your products online. Set one up for your business in minutes!
Get started with Product Links →
Common Questions
Can I set up different prices for different variants of the same product?
Yes, you can set different prices for multiple variants of the same product. So, a black shoe may cost 100 GHS, for instance, while the brown variant costs 120 GHS.
How many variant options can be created per product?
You can create up to three variant options per product. For instance, you may have the following variants for a shirt: size, colour, and fabric type.
How do I receive my Low Stock alerts?
You will only receive a low stock alert if you set a threshold quantity. If your number of available units falls below this number, we will automatically send an email to everyone on your team who has the permissions to create and manage products. Regardless of whether you set a low stock threshold, we will automatically email you when you sell out a product.

Can merchants in Ghana and South Africa use Product Links?
Yes, all Paystack merchants in all countries in which we operate can use Product Links.
How do I use Product Links?
Here's a comprehensive tutorial that shows you how to create products and sell with Product Links.
Does it cost extra to create Product Links?
No, Product Links are completely free to use and come at no additional cost. You only pay for the transaction processing fee. Learn more on our Pricing page.

As we head into the end of the year shopping season, we hope these new features help boost your sales. If you have any questions at all, please don't hesitate to reach out to us. We're happy to help!",blog

Paystack is joining Stripe
Paystack will be joining Stripe to accelerate online and offline commerce across Africa
Shola Akinlade
CEO, 					Paystack
On this page
About Paystack
We're doubling down on Paystack's mission
About Stripe
What happens next
Hi everyone - Shola here (Paystack co-founder and CEO) with an important community update.
I'm thankful to share that Paystack is joining the Stripe family. We’ll be acquired by Stripe to accelerate online commerce across Africa, pending standard closing conditions including regulatory approvals.
About Paystack
Paystack is a technology company powering growth for businesses in Africa through our collection of secure payment tools.
Over 60,000 businesses of all sizes use our suite of Collections, Disbursements, Identity Verification, Reporting, and Commerce tools to grow their business across the continent, including FedEx, UPS, MTN, the Lagos Internal Revenue Service, and AXA Mansard. Merchants already use our technology to process hundreds of millions of dollars each month, and joining forces with Stripe will supercharge our ability to serve our community of makers and help more businesses across the continent.
We're PCI DSS Level 1 Certified, the most stringent level of certification in the global payments industry, enabling companies to transact across Africa safely and securely.
We're doubling down on Paystack's mission
Paystack will continue to operate independently, and there will be no disruption of service as a result of this acquisition. If you’re using Paystack today, there’s no need to change anything about your technical integrations.
Paystack merchants and partners can look forward to more payment channels, more tools, accelerated geographic expansion, and deeper integrations with global platforms. We will continue to execute against an ambitious roadmap with the support of Stripe's resources and deep expertise.
About Stripe
Stripe is a technology company that builds economic infrastructure for the internet. Companies of all sizes - including Amazon, Google, Shopify, and Zoom - use Stripe's software to accept payments and scale their online businesses. Each year, more than 80% of American adults complete a purchase using Stripe.
This acquisition is the culmination of a close partnership between Stripe and Paystack over the last several years. Both companies are alums of the Y Combinator accelerator program, and Stripe led our Series A round of funding in 2018.
We also share a strong cultural DNA. We value voracious curiosity and transparency, we're inspired by hard challenges, and we're profoundly optimistic about the future.
 			Stripes and Paystack crew meeting up in Lagos last year 		
As we continued to work with and learn from each other, we realized that we could accomplish a lot more, faster, by joining forces. Stripe's mission is to increase the GDP of the internet, and Paystack will spearhead this effort in Africa.
What happens next
Paystack today is 114 friends of 12 nationalities, currently working remotely across 9 countries. What happens next is that we go right back to work, because there is so much that we can fix and improve in Africa’s financial infrastructure.
There is a lot more we want to share about Paystack’s journey to this point, but this isn't the time for it. We don't want to draw attention away from the very serious conversations happening at all levels about police violence in Nigeria, especially against young makers. As a maker myself, and member of the tech community (a frequent target of the attacks) this matters deeply to me and to everyone at Paystack.
In mid-July last year, we hosted a joint meetup with Stripe where several entrepreneurs came together to share with each other what they were working on. It was a powerful reminder of the potential and the promise of our community.
 			July 2019 - One of the presentations at the Paystack Stripe Meetup 		
These makers deserve an enabling environment that allows them to dare more, and build beautiful, useful things with friends, safe in the knowledge that they will be able to enjoy the fruit of their labour.
They, and millions of other African creators like them, deserve more.
In the near future, we will share a lot more behind-the-scenes details about our journey. Until then, I would like to thank the entire Paystack team, investors, and above all, our merchants, for your support and belief in us over the last five years.
In partnership with Stripe, we're excited to continue to help build a new generation of transformative businesses across Africa.
Lots more - much more - soon.
Onwards.

Introducing Multiple Transaction Splits
Split incoming payments into two or more bank accounts and mobile money accounts with automated rules

Common Questions
Need any help?
We're excited to announce Multiple Transaction Splits, a new feature which helps you automatically split your incoming payments into two or more bank accounts or mobile money accounts.
It was previously possible to split incoming transactions into one other payout account, but Multiple Splits lets you split into an unlimited number of bank accounts or mobile money accounts.
Shareable Takeaway
Paystack's Multiple Transaction Splits helps you automatically split your incoming payments into two or more bank accounts or mobile money accounts.
 					Share on WhatsApp 				 					Share on Facebook 				 					Share on Twitter 				

There are several interesting ways to use this feature, but here's a look at some of the more popular implementations.
A school using Multiple Transaction Splits
Let's take a fictional school, Blue Skies Academy, for example. They provide the following paid services and products to their students:
Transportation to and from school
School uniforms
Textbooks
Extracurricular activities, such as dance and swimming classes
Blue Skies Academy may decide to use the Multiple Transaction Splits feature to automatically split each student's school fees to all the units providing services to the student — the transportation unit, the tailors, the book publishers, and external swimming and dance instructors.
It keeps things super simple, and everyone instantly receives the money they need to provide services to each student.
An ecommerce marketplace using Multiple Transaction Splits
Let's take a fictional ecommerce marketplace, Bloom. Many vendors sell on Bloom's platform and customers can choose to place one order while buying from as many vendors as they like. Using Multiple Transaction Splits, Bloom automatically splits each order payment with all the vendors the customer bought from.
So, say a customer buys from two vendors on Bloom and checks out. Each vendor would immediately receive their share of the payment, and Bloom will also get to keep their cut.
A housing estate using Multiple Transaction Splits
In many cities, it's common to find housing estates where tenants pay a basic rent as well as monthly charges for services such as security guards, electricity, water, cleaning, and maintenance of shared spaces.
Using Transaction Splits, Estate Managers can automatically split service charges to all the units that provide services to the tenants.
Types of splits
There are two types of splits — the Percentage Split and the Flat Split. Here's a breakdown of how each works:
 			Percentage and flat splits 		
The Percentage Split
The Percentage Split automatically splits your incoming payments into multiple bank accounts in pre-determined percentages.
So, say Blue Skies Academy decides to split every payment they receive with two other parties — Arise Book Publishers (their textbook suppliers) and GoodStitch School Uniforms (their tailors). Using Percentage Splits, they could do this type of split:
 			The percentage split 		
So, for every school fee received, Arise Book Publishers will receive 10% of the payment, GoodStitch School Uniforms will receive 5%, and Blue Skies Academy keeps the remaining 85%.
The Flat Split
The Flat Split option helps you split specific amounts into multiple bank accounts when you receive payments.
Say Sunshine Housing Estate decides to collect a service charge of 20,000 Naira per month. Using the Flat Split option, they could split fixed amounts for services such as electricity (10,000 Naira) and water (5,000 Naira), while they receive the remaining 5,000 Naira. Here's what it would look like:
 			The flat split 		
You can set up complex split logic for all kinds of use cases
The flat split and percentage split options available via the Paystack Dashboard work best in a situation where every customer pays the same amount, but you can leverage the Paystack API to set up more complicated split logic.
Static Transaction Splits
For transactions where every customer pays exactly the same amount, you know exactly how much to expect, and you can use the flat or percentage splits to share the payments into multiple bank accounts. These are static transaction splits, and in such situations, you can quickly set up the splits through the Paystack Dashboard.
Dynamic Transaction Splits
There are situations, however, where you may not know how much the customer will pay until they're about to checkout. For example, think about an ecommerce marketplace which has multiple vendors and collects 10% of all payments made on the platform.
For these type of payments, the marketplace can leverage the Paystack API to give Paystack more specific instructions such as these:
If a customer buys from just one vendor, Vendor A, split the payments this way: 90% to Vendor A and 10% to the marketplace.
If a customer buys an apple from Vendor A, and a ball from Vendor B, split the payment this way:
90% of the cost of the apple should go to Vendor A, while 10% of the cost of the apple goes to the marketplace
90% of the cost of the ball should go to Vendor B, while 10% of the cost of the ball goes to the marketplace
In such situations, the marketplace could use the Transaction Split API to seamlessly handle the slightly more complicated logic.
Common Questions
Is Multiple Transaction Splits enabled for my business?
Multiple Transaction Splits is enabled for all Paystack merchants in Ghana and Nigeria by default. To get started, simply login to your Paystack Dashboard, and click on the Transaction Splits menu. Here's a detailed explainer on how to set up splits for your transactions.
What types of transactions are transaction splits enabled for?
Transactions accepted via the following channels can all be split:
Paystack Invoices
Paystack Payment Pages
Your custom integrations (eg. website or mobile app) using the Paystack API
Who gets charged when a transaction is split?
Depending on your preference, the transaction fee may be deducted from you (the business owner), any single member of the other parties you're splitting the payment with, or it could be split among everyone who's receiving the payment.
Here's what the transaction fee deduction setting would look like for Blue Skies Academy:
 			Transaction charge splits 		
Find out more about transaction fee deductions for transaction splits in this Help Centre article.
Can I create and manage Transaction Splits via the Paystack API?
Yes, you can create and manage transaction splits via the Paystack API. Get started with the Transaction Splits API documentation.
Can I split into multiple currencies at a time?
No, you can't. You may only split into one currency at a time — NGN, GHS, or USD.
Is there a maximum number of bank accounts or mobile money accounts I can split into?
No, there's no maximum at all. You can split payments into as many bank accounts as you like — two, ten, fifty — it's all up to you :)

How does Kuda Pay with Bank work?
Common Questions
Need any help?
As a business owner, your customers should be able to pay you however they choose to. This is why we're excited to add Kuda Bank as an option to our Pay with Bank payment channel. Going forward, your customers who use Kuda Bank will be able to pay you by simply entering their phone numbers on the Paystack Checkout Form.
Let's do a quick recap on what Pay with Bank is.
What is Pay with Bank?
Pay with Bank is one of several payment channels on Paystack through which customers can pay you. Using this option, a customer simply enters a bank account detail (such as their bank account number or phone number) to start a transaction.

Introducing Address Verification Service
Enjoy improved success rates on international transactions

How does AVS work?
How does this help your business?
Common Questions
In Summary
We're excited to announce Paystack's integration to the Address Verification Service (AVS) — an authentication system which makes it possible for a lot more international customers to pay you.
Before now, our primary method of authentication was through 3DS — a security system which ensures that payment cards aren't used online without the consent of the card owner. 3DS works well for most local payment cards and some international cards, but many international cards are not enrolled for 3DS.
With the integration to AVS, our success rates for international transactions have improved by 150%, and you can now get paid by more customers in the USA, UK, and Canada.
Shareable Takeaway
Paystack has improved success rates for international transactions significantly, thanks to the new Address Verification Service integration.
 					Share on WhatsApp 				 					Share on Facebook 				 					Share on Twitter 				
How does AVS work?
When a customer attempts a payment on Paystack, we verify that the payment is authorised by the customer, and not someone pretending to be them. This helps us to protect the customer from theft, and protect your business from chargeback claims.
In some parts of the world where it's less usual for cards to be enrolled for 3DS - specifically the United States of America, the United Kingdom, and Canada - we now use the Address Verification Service (also known as the Address Verification System) to authenticate each transaction.
 			The AVS interface on the Paystack Checkout Form 		
Here's a quick breakdown of how AVS works:
A customer paying with an international card enters their card number, card expiry date, and CVV
Next, they enter their street address, ZIP code, state, and city
We then automatically compare the billing address they provide with what their card issuer has on file
If there's a match, the transaction is authorised, and you receive the payment
How does this help your business?
When you sell online, you want to accept payments from customers all over the world. Our new integration with the global Address Verification Service helps you do just that by ensuring that more customers from the United States of America, the United Kingdom, and Canada can pay you successfully.
Common Questions
Is AVS enabled for my business?
AVS is currently enabled for Paystack merchants in Nigeria, but we aim to make it available to merchants in Ghana as soon as possible.
All Nigerian merchants who are enabled for international payments are automatically enabled for AVS, with the exception of a small handful of relatively high-risk business categories such as betting. See this Help Center article for full details of these restrictions.
Is AVS enabled for all international customers?
AVS is enabled for cards issued in the United States of America, the United Kingdom, and Canada.
There are about three additional countries in the world which support AVS authorisation, but the AVS technology is not as robustly rolled out in those countries, so we decided to err on the side of a robust integration and provide AVS authorization for those countries where AVS works reliably. Happily, we find that the vast majority of international transactions come from the US, UK, and Canada, so you're very well covered. As AVS matures and works reliably for cards issued in more countries, we will be sure to enable it for Paystack merchants.
Can customers outside the USA, UK, and Canada pay me?
Yes, if you're enabled for international payments on Paystack, customers from anywhere in the world can pay you, not only those from the USA, UK, and Canada. Our AVS integration only improves success rates from those countries specifically. Learn more about collecting international payments with Paystack.
In Summary
One of our big promises to you has always been that we'll help you accept payments from anyone, anywhere in the world. With the new integration to the Address Verification Service, we're excited about opening up your business to more customers from more parts of the world.
If you have any question at all about AVS, kindly reach out to us here. We're happy to help ❤️",blog

What's Paystack Music?
Designing Paystack Music
Building Paystack Music
Build a Spotify-Slack music bot of your own
When we're not building payments infrastructure for Africa, you'll find us listening to and sharing a lot of music with each other.
And because we come from a diverse range of backgrounds, the music we share spans a wide variety of genres, moods, time periods — even languages. The Slack channel where these tracks are shared is a treasure chest of great finds.
Many months ago, Kachi built a Slack bot that automatically creates a recurring Spotify playlist of all the music we shared with each other that month. A handful of people outside the company seemed to really enjoy them, so a number of Paystack designers and engineers volunteered to create a custom experience to make it easier for our entire community to rediscover old favourites, and unearth new ones.
The result is Paystack Music, where you can easily listen to monthly mixtapes of the music we share with each other on Slack.
In this article, we share how it all came together, including the design iterations, the tech stack it's built on, the source code for our music bot, and more.
Tune in to Paystack Music
Let the Paystack team put you on to your next favourite song.
Go to Paystack Music →
What's Paystack Music?
At Paystack, when we find music we like, we share to a #fun-music channel on Slack for others to enjoy.
At the end of each month, our music bot automatically fetches all the Spotify tracks, creates a mixtape with custom cover art, and publishes it online.
Like the people who co-created them, each playlist is an eclectic mix, so don't be surprised if a grime track is followed by amapiano 😅
Each mixtape is a snapshot of a moment in time, capturing the shared highs and lows of the ~100 friends who make Paystack. Each is a tapestry of many colours, spun by many hands.
Designing Paystack Music
We approach most of our projects design-first. The animating questions include 'How do we want you to feel when you explore Paystack Music?' and 'What experiences do we want you to have?'
Shareable Takeaway
Paystack Music houses monthly mixtapes of the music we share with each other on Slack. This is how we built it.
 					Share on WhatsApp 				 					Share on Facebook 				 					Share on Twitter 				
We spent some time answering these questions, checked out various existing curated online music experiences, and went through a number of iterations before arriving at an experience we were all excited about. Here is the list of the sites which inspired our thinking →
Creating a design guideline
Since this isn't a Paystack payment product, we had the freedom to stretch our brand guidelines and bring in new elements, such as pastel gradients. Once we arrived at a sense of feel and aesthetics we were all happy with, we created a design guide for the project:
Create a clean and airy layout
Use soft, delightful elements with no sharp edges
Incorporate minimal typography and lots of white spaces
Bring in fluid motions and interactions
Inspired by these guidelines, we then created a team task board, split ourselves into micro teams, and kickstarted design explorations and low fidelity prototyping in Figma.
 			A screenshot from one of our peer design sessions 		
Once each team had a prototype in place, we all compared notes and merged the best ideas from each team.
Paystack Music is simple by design, and there are only four pages:
The home page which introduces the project
The Playlist Catalogue from where you choose a playlist
The Playlist page from where you play the songs on the playlist, see which member of the Paystack team shared each song, and get a sense of the playlist's mood — happy, energetic, or dance-heavy
The About page where you can learn more about Paystack Music and see everyone who contributed to the project.
Let's dive deeper into each page.
Designing the Playlist Catalogue page
This Catalogue page is where a visitor can browse through the various mixtapes. We were inspired by the experience of browsing physical vinyl records in stores, and you can see that idea come through in the early explorations.
Over time we moved away from bunching the mixtapes together and started experimenting with giving each one more breathing room.
While experimenting with various layouts, we realised that a radial layout allowed us to introduce a navigation element at the bottom of the page that feels like an old-school radio dial.
We also increased the functionality of the page by layering a Spotify Code onto the playlist cover art. Spotify Codes work very similarly to QR codes. You can scan them using the Spotify app on your mobile device, and it instantly opens up the relevant playlist.
Designing the Playlist Page
The early playlist page placed more emphasis on the individual songs and their respective cover art, but this didn't quite work well because we have many dozens of songs per playlist.
While playing with the Spotify API, we also realised that Spotify provides metadata such as how 'energetic' or 'danceable' songs are. We made this information more visible in the design as a metadata section.
We created custom illustrations for this metadata section. Following our design guidelines, we relied on simple, relatable metaphors - such as a disco ball for danceable music, a battery for energetic music, and balloons for happy music - and implemented them in a soft, chunky style with rounded edges.
Finally, we sought out ways to visually highlight the single most special thing about playlists - that each playlist is curated by several members of the Paystack team.

We designed the page to show who contributed each song in that month's playlist. To implement this, we leveraged the Slack API to show the name, headshot, and bio of each team member who shared a track in the #fun-music channel.
By default, Spotify lets you play 30-second snippets of songs for free, but eager listeners can log into their Spotify account to listen to full tracks.
Shareable Takeaway
To quickly play a Paystack Music playlist on your phone, open the Spotify app and scan the special Spotify code on the cover of your preferred playlist.
 					Share on WhatsApp 				 					Share on Facebook 				 					Share on Twitter 				
Building Paystack Music
The Paystack Music Bot is the beating heart of this project.
It's the API that fetches the Spotify URLs from Slack and creates the monthly playlists. We'll be open-sourcing the Music Bot soon, so you can make Slack mixtapes for your own team.
The Music Bot (v1.0)
The very first version of the Paystack Music bot did only one thing — creating monthly Spotify playlists from the songs we share on the #fun-music Slack channel — and it did it well.
The bot was a lightweight Node.js/Express application using LowDB for data storage. Here're all the processes it executed:
1. Fetch music tracks from the #fun-music channel: The bot would read through all the messages on #fun-music using Slack's Conversations History API, filter them and only select messages with a Spotify URL in them.
 			A screenshot of a Slack message that has a Spotify URL in it 		
2. Create a Spotify playlist and add the tracks: Spotify's APIs provide endpoints for creating a playlist and adding tracks to the playlist. The bot would use these endpoints to create and populate a Spotify playlist named after the month when the tracks were shared on #fun-music (e.g 'March 2020'.)
3. Create a playlist cover image: Spotify creates a default cover image using a collage of the first 4 tracks in the playlist. We wanted to bring some of Paystack's brand to each cover image, so we opted for a simple, single hue design with Paystack's logomark at the top right, and the playlist's name at the bottom right. The background hue for each cover is determined by the most dominant colours that appear on the covers of the first four tracks of each playlist. To create each cover, we:
Use Color Thief library to extract the dominant colour in the first four tracks of the playlist
Use Puppeteer to generate an HTML page with the Paystack logomark and the playlist name
Automatically take a screenshot of the page, and upload it as the new cover image.
 			Cover images of twelve playlists showing off the various hues 		
4. Send playlist URL to channel: After a playlist is created, the bot would then share a link to the Spotify playlist on #fun-music using another one of Slack's APIs.
 			A screenshot of the Paystack Music bot sending a playlist to #fun-music 		
We used Zapier (which allows you automate simple, repetitive tasks) to trigger the playlist creation at the beginning of every month. We set it up to send a POST request to our playlist endpoint on the first day of every month at 6 am.
The Music Bot (v2.0)
The v1.0 of the bot worked well within the Slack-Spotify loop. To be able to expose the project to the outside world through Paystack Music, however, we had to make a few changes that would help us:
Fetch the list of playlists and details about each playlist.
Collect more data about the tracks in each playlist, such as the artists' names.
Fetch all the microsite data without calling any external APIs. This helps us optimise for speed and avoid being rate-limited.
Store playlist data properly. V1.0 of the bot used LowDB, which worked well because all we had to store were Spotify authentication tokens which are temporary. Once we started storing tracks, artists, playlists and contributors, however, we knew it would quickly fall apart because of the short life span of our web server. We decided to use MongoDB. LowDB is a small JSON local database that would not be suitable for storing all the data we planned to. Mongo allowed us to store larger bits of data and provided a database server which meant we could inspect and query our data easily without having to SSH into our application server.
To make Paystack Music work, we updated our music bot so it can now:
Save contributor profiles: The profiles of contributors who share tracks on #fun-music are fetched and stored in the database. In the scenario where more than one person shares a track in a month, they're all added as contributors for the track.
Fetch each track's mood: Every song evokes a mood — happy, high-energy, etc. — and we wanted to share a sense of the general mood that the playlist itself gives off. Was the team vibing to Sean Paul-type hyper or Lana Del Rey-type sombreness? Spotify's Audio Features API allows us to fetch these insights.
Save playlists/tracks: Metadata for the playlist and tracks are saved in the database so they can be served to the microsite.
How we built the UI
We always try to serve the lightest possible frontend code to users, so we typically limit our dependency on frameworks and libraries.
We built Paystack Music using HTML, CSS and Javascript. We also used two very lightweight libraries — Splitting JS and Dogstudio's Highway — for in-page interactions. Tree shaking and bundling happen via Parcel, and our modified version of Airbnb's base Eslint config helped us harmonise our code.
Generating playlist pages
 			Screenshot showing a successful build process 		
To optimise browser performance, we generate all HTML pages on the server-side. We built a lightweight NodeJS-based static site generator to help with this. The NodeJS app retrieves playlist information via our custom Paystack Music API and generates static HTML pages for each playlist. We use Shopify's LiquidJS as the templating engine to generate HTML.
One challenge we faced was setting up the correct deployment order. We wanted to generate HTML pages pre-build, so Parcel could run the necessary optimisations behind the scenes. To solve this, we ported the NodeJS app to a Netlify build plugin. This gave us access to Netlify's lifecycle hook. With this, we were able to achieve our ideal flow: Push to Github > Generate Static playlist pages > Run Parcel's Build script > Serve the site to the user.
Iterating on the Player
We originally intended to allow visitors to listen to full tracks in the browser, right on the Playlist page, by using Spotify's Web Playback SDK.
 			Previous player with the login to Spotify button 		
During testing, however, we noticed a few performance inconsistencies across browsers. With our deadline fast approaching, we decided to optimize the user experience to allow visitors listen to 30-second song previews, and direct them to the Spotify or Apple Music app where they'll be able to listen to the full song. We also automatically skip to the next song after the end of each preview, which creates a radio-like listening experience.
The current implementation makes use of the browser's native audio API and triggers song previews on demand.
 			Updated player with login option removed 		
We intend to revisit this in a later iteration and hopefully figure out an optimal way to allow visitors log into Spotify and listen to full tracks right on the page.
Animations and Page Transitions
We always try to use the simplest tool for the job, and as a result, default to CSS animation for a lot of our animations. Depending on the use case, we sometimes augment these animations with CSS variables, set dynamically with Javascript. We use similar easing functions across all our animations and tweak animation duration accordingly.
Build a Spotify-Slack music bot of your own
We had so much fun leveraging the Slack and Spotify APIs to build this project, and we’ve made the source code public so you can build automatic monthly mixtapes for your team or other exciting projects of your own.

Common Questions
Need any help?
One of the promises we make at Paystack is that we’ll help you accept payment however your customers choose to pay. In Nigeria, payments via transfers are very popular, so we've built a new payment channel — Pay with Transfer — through which your Nigeria-based customers can pay you.
Shareable Takeaway
Paystack has launched Pay with Transfer, a new payment channel which helps you accept payments via bank transfers from your Nigeria-based customers.
 					Share on WhatsApp 				 					Share on Facebook 				 					Share on Twitter 				
How does it work?
Your customers can now pay you via a bank transfer by tapping on the Transfer option on the Paystack Checkout. When they tap on Transfer, we instantly generate a Zenith or Providus bank account number to which they can make a bank transfer payment.
Most customers do bank transfers from their banking mobile app. Once they do, the transaction is automatically approved, and the paid amount immediately reflects on your Dashboard like any other Paystack payment.
We've turned on Pay with Transfer for all merchants except those who manually turned off the Pay with Bank payment option. If you’d like to disable (or enable) the Pay with Transfer option for any reason, simply go to the Preferences page on your Dashboard, and uncheck (or check) the Transfer option as shown in the screenshot below.
The benefits of accepting payment via Pay with Transfer
Here’re some reasons why you and your customers will love Pay with Transfer:
A familiar payment option for customers who're less comfortable with online payment: Many Nigerian customers who aren’t yet comfortable paying online with their debit cards are a lot more comfortable with doing bank transfers from their bank apps. You can expect more business from such customers.
Easy reconciliation and analysis: While it's possible to give a bank account number to customers manually, reconciling those payments by hand can be a huge pain. At scale, accepting transfer payments piecemeal like this becomes almost impossible. This is why large companies such as airlines usually don't offer bank transfers as a payment channel, despite how popular this option is - it's simply too difficult to keep track of those payments by hand. With Paystack Pay with Transfer, all transfer payment appear on your Dashboard, and then once on the Dashboard, you can leverage the full power of the Dashboard's business management tools, including financial reporting and refund management.
Build detailed customer profiles: Unlike with regular bank transfers, you can build a rich profile of customers who pay you using Pay with Transfer. Every Pay with Transfer payment adds to a valuable customer database of details such as names, email addresses and phone numbers, which you can use to build lasting relationships with them and sell more.
Pricing
Pay with Transfer has exactly the same pricing as the other payment channels. Kindly see the Pricing page for up-to-date pricing info.
Common Questions
Will customers be transferring money directly into my bank account? No. When the customer chooses the Pay with Transfer option, we automatically assign them a bank account number specifically for that particular transaction. Once the payment has been made, the payment instantly reflects on your Paystack Dashboard, and the bank account number disappears.
What’s the best way for customers to make a transfer? Most customers prefer to make a transfer using their banking app or USSD.
How much does it cost the customer to pay with transfer? The Central Bank of Nigeria has specified that transfers below N10,000 should cost customers a maximum of N10 and transfers above N50,000 should cost a maximum of N50, but some platforms charge much less than this (some even charge no fees at all for transfers). Reminder: this charge is not from Paystack. It's from the platform that the customer uses to make the bank transfer.
Can customers do recurring payments with the Pay with Transfer channel? No, recurring payments can't be made with the Pay with Transfer channel.

Managing Webhooks
Whenever actions are carried out on your Paystack account, we trigger events which your application can listen and respond to. Before now, to implement webhook routes like these, you had to:
Deploy your code to a publicly available URL
Login to your Paystack Dashboard and set the webhook URL
Make a test payment
Review logs
With the Paystack CLI, all these steps are reduced to running a single command:
$ webhook listen localhost:8080/webhook

The CLI tunnels your test events to your local server running on port 8080, making it possible for you to run end-to-end tests on your Paystack integration while in development mode. You can also run health checks on your webhook URL by sending different sample event objects to your server. Simply run:
$ webhook ping --event transfer.success --domain test
This sends a sample transfer.success event to your test webhook URL and returns the response.
Using the API
All Paystack endpoints are accessible via the Paystack CLI. To test the API, all request parameters should be passed as flags as shown below.

As our product suite grew, it became harder for developers to find the information they needed, so one of the major things we focused on was to improve discoverability.
Smarter content grouping: We grouped all the content on the new Documentation under five categories — accepting payments, sending money, identifying your customers, Libraries & Plugins, and Guides. This makes finding the information you need easier and more intuitive.
A faster search experience: Searching across the Documentation is now blazing fast thanks to Algolia.
Quick summaries: New 'In a nutshell' summaries, bold warnings, and clear tips make it easier to quickly see most important things you need to know on every page.
Faster load time: The new Documentation is optimised for speed on both mobile and desktop. We fine-tuned everything so pages load a lot faster.
Shareable Takeaway
Take a look at Paystack's brand new and improved Developer Documentation.

In Summary
As part of our Commerce efforts, we're on a mission to give African creators access to the world-class tools they need to bring ideas to market.
This is why we're thrilled to be one of the first payment platforms in Africa to officially partner and integrate directly with Wix, a leading ecommerce platform. With over 170 million users worldwide, Wix provides businesses with all the professional tools they need to promote and sell products and services online.
Before now, businesses in Ghana and Nigeria had to go through complex workarounds to get paid on their Wix sites. Using Paystack, you can now accept payments in Cedis, Naira, as well as other international currencies such as USD, from anyone, anywhere in the world.
Shareable Takeaway
Paystack has announced one of the first direct integrations in Africa with Wix, a popular platform for building professional websites.

Wix offers businesses of all sizes the tools they need to build professional websites, without knowing how to code.
With Wix’s innovative drag and drop website builder, you can start from scratch or choose from over 500 designer-made templates. Of course, if you do know how to code and want to create more custom websites, you can add advanced functionality to your site with Corvid and use Editor X.
Depending on your business type, Wix also has lots of ready to go solutions to choose from. Paystack merchants can now collect payments through the following Wix apps:
Wix Stores: Wix Stores gives you all the tools you need to create a sleek, professional online store and grow your ecommerce business.
Wix Bookings: Wix Bookings offers a complete online scheduling software which allows clients to book appointments and services, and pay online.
Wix Events: With Wix Events, you can create events, list them on your site, manage RSVPs and guestlists, and sell tickets.
Wix Music: Wix Music gives you everything you need to list, promote and sell your music commission-free.
Wix Videos: With Wix Videos, you can showcase your videos, engage your visitors and monetise your content!
Please note: it is currently not possible to collect payments through Paystack for the following apps - Wix Hotels, Wix Restaurants, and Wix Pricing Plans (recurring payments).
Here're some of our favourite Wix websites
We've been excited to see several creators and brands leverage this new integration. Here are a few of them:
Fabila's Fitness uses Wix Bookings to manage her fitness classes and then accepts online payments using Paystack.

A brief history of commerce at Paystack
We've always had a number of seller tools on the Paystack Dashboard. Thousands of creators use our Payment Pages, Invoices, and Subscriptions features every month to power sales.
But in 2019, we started to wonder: what would happen if we significantly increased investment in our seller tools, on the same level as our other product lines? This kicked off a company-wide effort to deepen our understanding of the needs of our commerce merchants.
 			Scene at the 2019 Holiday Commerce Bootcamp 		
At a roundtable with social commerce merchants, we learned how one food entrepreneur found herself managing a private fleet of delivery motorbikes out of necessity because she had struggled so much with outsourcing delivery.
At the 2019 Holiday Commerce Bootcamp, former Jumia Senior Content Editor (and now Paystack Content Marketer) Temitope Olaleye shared strategies for maximising sales during the massive Black Friday/Cyber Monday shopping period.
 			COL Fragrances, one of the brands in the 2019 Holiday Gift Guide 		
For the 2019 Holiday Gift Guide, we spent months working closely with 15 of our favourite Ghanaian and Nigerian brands to turn Instagram into a novel pop-up store experience.
And then in 2020, COVID-19 upended the world, creating even greater need and urgency for a new generation of tools to help African brands sell online.
After months of learning and iteration, we're excited to share our vision for online commerce.
New: Sell more with beautiful Product Links
A Product Link is a simple, high converting page for selling one product beautifully.
 			Paystack Product Link 		
 			Product inventory view 		
With a Product Link, you can:
Design an attractive product detail page with custom background colours, photos, videos, animated GIFs, and detailed product descriptions
Collect shipping fees for different delivery options, and easily collect delivery addresses and delivery notes
View and manage inventory and orders (eg. mark an order as delivered, change shipping details, etc)
Track orders with the recently-announced Paystack Merchant app, and lots more!

As we continue to build out Paystack Commerce, our product philosophy is shaped by four promises. When you use Paystack Commerce tools...
More customers will find you in more places: Distribution can make all the difference. We're obsessed with helping creators get in front of more customers in more places.
When they find you, we'll convince more of them to buy: Your selling pages should work as hard as your best employee. We design them to make sure that almost everyone who visits your page converts to a customer.
When they buy, they will place larger orders: We'll give you proven promotional tools to nudge customers to make bigger orders, every time.
And they will become loyal, repeat customers, for life: We'll help you build personal, intimate relationships with each customer, and keep them coming back again and again.
To make good on these promises we must make sure at all times that we're solving the most important problems for African creators, and that we have a deep understanding of those problems.
This is why we've made our Commerce Product Roadmap completely public.
We hope that this helps establish a strong feedback loop that results in iterative improvement over time.

Pricing
Need any help?
As a business owner, your customers should be able to pay you, however they prefer to pay you. This is why we’re excited to introduce a new payment option. Customers can now pay Nigeria-based merchants using Zenith Bank’s *966# channel.
This means customers in Nigeria now have the choice of four bank options within the Pay with USSD channel: Guaranty Trust Bank, United Bank for Africa, Sterling Bank, and now, Zenith Bank.
How Pay with USSD works
Once a customer of any of the four available banks selects their bank option, they'll see the special USSD code they'll need to dial into their phone. Doing this will trigger an automated USSD sequence which will guide the customer through authorising the transaction from their bank account.
How to enable Zenith Bank *966# collections
If you already have USSD enabled as a payment channel in your Paystack Dashboard, you don't need to do a thing - Zenith Bank *966# has already been enabled for you.
To confirm that you have USSD enabled, kindly visit the Preferences page of your Paystack Dashboard, and look at the 'Accept payments via' section. If USSD is checked, your customers will be able to pay you via GTB *737#, UBA *919#, Sterling Bank *822#, and Zenith Bank *966#.
The benefit of collecting USSD payments via Paystack
In addition to high transaction success rates, all USSD payments processed through Paystack enjoy the benefits of being captured on the Paystack Dashboard, including harmonised financial reporting and exports, granular user permissions so that different members of your team can access transaction data, the ability to quickly issue refunds or manage disputes, and much more.
Pricing
These new payment channels have exactly the same pricing as all other payments channels - there's no change in pricing. Kindly see the Pricing page for up-to-date pricing info.

Common questions
Another world is possible. Let's build it together.
We're excited to introduce Paystack Fintech Office Hours - a series of intimate, 1-on-1 conversations aimed at providing insight and guidance to startups building all types of financial service products for Africa.
Paystack is fortunate to sit on multiple sides of the fintech table. We serve as a payment infrastructure provider, interfacing with banks, regulators and card schemes. We also work closely with hundreds of some of the most ambitious fintech companies in Africa as their payment gateway. This provides us with many unique perspectives on what it takes to start and scale a fintech on the continent.
With Fintech Office Hours, we're looking to leverage everything we've learned in the service of a new generation of African fintechs.
Shareable Takeaway
We’re excited to announce Paystack Fintech Office Hours — intimate 1-on-1 peer conversations to provide insight and guidance to startups building financial service products for Africa.
 					Share on WhatsApp 				 					Share on Facebook 				 					Share on Twitter 				
How it works
Office Hours are private, 1-on-1 Zoom calls where you'll have a chance to speak deeply with people who've been in your shoes. These calls will be led by Paystack Technical Product Specialists, the team that works closely with both startups and corporates to implement our most critical and most robust integrations.
Depending on your needs, the Technical Product Specialists might also invite domain experts from across the company - designers, marketers, legal, etc. - as well as experts from our wider network of groundbreaking fintechs. We'll always check with you in advance about who we're thinking of inviting to your session, so you'll never be surprised by who shows up on the call.
The content of the discussion will focus entirely on your specific challenges. We'll cover a broad range of topics, including but not limited to
the APIs and tools you need to build elegant solutions
licensing and compliance issues when scaling
product management and software development
user acquisition, sales, and growth
hiring, people ops, and much more
After your Office Hours session, you'll be added to a private community of Office Hours alums. These are your peers, company builders like yourself who're working to build the next wave of disruptive African fintechs.
Applications will open for two weeks each quarter, and each cohort will have up to 10 fintechs each.
Who is eligible to apply?
Fintech Office Hours are intended for teams who've seen some early success in the market and are looking to take things to the next level. Kindly consider applying if:
You're building a financial services product. This can include accounting and invoicing solutions, savings, lending, and investment apps, and everything in between
You have a working product that is live in the market and in use by the general public
You're targeting users in Nigeria or Ghana
You're seeing strong growth in your monthly Total Processed Volume (TPV). 10% month-on-month growth is decent.
In future, we intend to open this opportunity to all fintechs, but we're limiting this first cohort only to companies with an active Paystack account. Once we work out the kinks, we definitely intend to open this opportunity up to everyone.

You're targeting users in Nigeria or Ghana
You're seeing strong growth in your monthly Total Processed Volume (TPV). 10% month-on-month growth is decent.
What happens if I'm not selected?
Due to the number of applications we expect, we likely won't be able to provide a custom explanation to everyone who didn't make it, but we'll certainly try. Regardless, we'll be running this every quarter, so definitely apply again.
Will I get funding if I'm selected?
No, Paystack Fintech Office Hours are not a fundraising program, and you will not receive funding if you're selected. What you will receive, however, is the kind of founder-to-founder insight that can only be found from working in the trenches.
Another world is possible. Let's build it together.
Paystack was founded on the earnest belief that with the right tools, entrepreneurs in Africa are unstoppable. We're inspired by the example of the thousands of fintechs who're pushing the continent forward, and we're committed to helping create thousands more.
Today, Paystack processes over 50% of all online payments in Nigeria, but it wasn't so long ago when we were just starting out. We've never forgotten the many people who helped us forge ahead with a well-placed word of advice, and we're excited to pay that kindness forward for a new generation of financial service technology companies.
If you fit the eligibility criteria, please don't hesitate to apply to Office Hours. We want to help, and we can't wait to meet you.

Offer online ordering, delivery, and pickup
When customers can’t come to you, you go to them. This is the most obvious strategy for selling during a lockdown, and we’ve seen several businesses, from the Eko Hotels and Suites in Lagos, to storied fine dining establishments like Chicago's Alinea, pivot to selling online and delivering directly to customers.
When it goes well, some businesses can make a significant percentage of their pre-lockdown sales through online ordering and delivery, as is the case with Alinea, which is making up to 75% of its regular revenue through online orders.

But there are big questions to think about. If you’re a food business in Ghana or Nigeria that’s new to selling on the internet, how do you get started? Do you piggyback on the discovery and delivery networks of third-party platforms like Jumia Food, or do you cut out the middleman and sell directly to customers? Here’re some broad factors to consider.
Listing on food delivery platforms vs. self-delivery
Here are some pros and cons of using a third party delivery company as compared to owning the delivery process:
Pros of third-party platforms
A food delivery platform gives you unparalleled distribution. Their apps and websites see a lot of traffic, and they could give you access to a broader audience, thereby increasing your chances of receiving orders
You get to focus on your domain expertise — making food and drinks — while you outsource the expensive business of deliveries to an experienced establishment
You could theoretically spend less energy on customer acquisition because the ordering platform does a lot of that for you already
Cons of third-party platforms
A delivery company sits between you and the customer. As a result of this, they own the customer relationship, not you. If you owned your delivery, you could potentially collect these customers’ contact details, and build enduring relationships over time
Once the food or drinks leave your establishment, you no longer control the customer's experience. How long does it take to get the food delivered? How courteous is the delivery person? How well does the meal travel, and is the food still in good shape when it arrives?
You pay a commission that could be anything from 10 - 30% per order to the delivery platforms. Depending on your profit margins, this could be expensive.
From a broad point of view, a lot of the decision making boils down to: can you afford to invest the resources necessary to build the infrastructure that allows you to own the entire customer relationship, or do you want to plug into an established system that gives you almost instant distribution?

Sell meal kits
With people self-isolating they're visiting the grocery store less and preparing more meals themselves. Food businesses have noticed, and some have succeeded in pivoting to take advantage of the trend by selling meal kits.
In what Bloomberg describes as 'soaring business for meal-kit firms,' meal kit companies like Blue Apron (USA) and Berlin-headquartered Hello Fresh have seen their stock value increase dramatically as people on lockdown embrace the meal kit model.
Meal kits — what are they and how do they work?
Photo: Blue Apron Meal Kit
Say a customer wants to prepare a large meal for their family of four. They see that a meal kit company is featuring a chicken, roasted potatoes, and green bean dinner. The company would send this customer a box containing all the ingredients and instructions needed to prepare that meal.
As more restaurants shut down and grocery stores shorten their operating hours, many people are meeting their fresh food needs with meal kits. Here're some reasons why meal kits are becoming so popular:
They're convenient. Meal kits take away the need for grocery runs, and you get every single ingredient you need for a particular meal delivered to you
Meal kits come pre-portioned, so whether it's a meal for one, two, or for a bigger family, the ingredients in the kit are portioned to make the perfect meal for a set number of people
Many people on lockdown are looking for ways to keep active and occupied. Meal kits fill that need, and they give many home cooks the excitement of making their own masterpieces out of 'lego blocks' of fresh ingredients
Get inspiration from other businesses selling meal kits
Here's a look at 2 food businesses that now sell meal kits, with notes on the things that make their approaches effective.
Shake Shack (USA)
Shake Shack is a popular American restaurant chain known for their burgers. They've leaned into the meal kit trend and started selling a kit that makes 8 Shake Shack burgers, complete with their trademark sauce. The thrill for many customers, especially those who already know the brand, is making their own Shake Shack burgers at home.
To get the word out about this new offering, they did a number of things well:
They leveraged their social media presence to announce the meal kit
They partnered with a popular food marketplace, Goldbelly, to make distribution across the country easier
They published a fun and instructive 5-minute video that shows you how to make a Shake Shack burger right at home.
Lazy Dog (USA)
Lazy Dog Restaurant & Bar is a California-based restaurant that serves classic American food and drinks. Something they did really well was to brand each meal kit with a fun, organizing theme.
For instance, the Brunch Kit comes with eggs, bacon, whipped cream, fresh orange juice, and pancake mix.
Photo: Lazy Dog Restaurant & Bar's Brunch Kit
The Backyard BBQ Kit, meanwhile, includes angus beef steaks, hot dogs, buns, and red potatoes.
Photo: Lazy Dog Restaurant & Bar's BBQ Kit
This makes it easy for customers to pick a meal kit based on mood or time of day.
Things to keep in mind when selling meal kits
If you're considering experimenting with meal kits, here's some thing you could consider.
Whittle down your menu to your crowd favourites and attempt to build meal kits around them.
Theme your meal kits in a fun way to capture attention and make it easy for customers to choose
Include simple cooking instructions to appeal to a broader audience, including people who're not yet very savvy in the kitchen
Don't forget to let your past customers know that you're now selling meal kits! These are some of your biggest fans, and they'll want to support you.
Invite your community to sponsor meals
One of the hard things about this period for food businesses is that with fewer orders coming through the door, it can be hard to keep employees on the payroll. Eventually, some business owners might need to make the painful decision to lay off members of their team.
To prevent this, some food businesses have found creative ways to keep their kitchens busy: they invite the community to sponsor a meal for others, such as frontline healthcare workers.
Delivering sponsored meals to hospitals in Harlem
Photo: Fieldtrip restaurant's Chef JJ
Fieldtrip is a Harlem-based restaurant owned by Chef JJ that sells bowls of rice. When the lockdown in New York began, CNBC reports that the restaurant's sales dwindled. One day, JJ's wife, a healthcare worker, came back home very hungry from a long shift — she hadn't eaten all day. The next day, he took 40 bowls of rice to a neighbourhood hospital and gave it to the workers for free. He also shared it on Twitter, and a movement was born. People wanted to contribute and donate so he could feed more people.
Fuelled by the donations, he was able to hire back 70% of his workforce, and he made it such that customers could include a small donation to feed healthcare workers when placing an order for themselves.
Lazy Dog's 'sponsor a meal' programme
Lazy Dog's Sponsor a Meal Programme
California-based Lazy Dog also did something similar. Every time a customer places an order, they get a small nudge to buy a meal for a healthcare worker. Customers can also go to a dedicated page to sponsor meals without necessarily placing an order.
Lazy Dog Restaurant & Bar
Back in Ghana and Nigeria, this is a model that could also work. Identify hospitals or communities that need help, and let your customers know that there's an option for them to help their communities while supporting your team. Given a reason to help, it's likely that people will rise up to the occasion to support a noble cause.

Sell custom cocktails and private label drinks
With most bars closed, people are eager to experiment with new ways to get a drink. If your establishment is known for unique cocktails, it might be worth exploring how to deliver your customers' favourite drinks to them.
Quacktails' cocktail delivery goes viral
Lagos implemented a four-week lockdown as a response to COVID-19. A few days into the lockdown, two 9-to-5ers launched Quacktails Cocktail Delivery, a cocktail brand that sold cheekily-named drinks in colourful pouches.

And that cute little guy 😍 pic.twitter.com/AqvaSdrKo2
— Maxine Rich Hipster (@Makxxy) April 29, 2020
The brand blew up, seemingly overnight. They soon saw their sales spike from about 30 pouches per day in the first week, to more than 250 a day in their fourth week, and it became common to see people sharing the now-iconic Quacktails pouch on Instagram Stories.
We had the pleasure of speaking with Quacktails founder Dare, and here's what we learned about some of the tactics behind their viral success.
They packaged their cocktails in fun, unconventional plastic pouches that many people were excited to take photos of and share online
Their impeccable customer service earned them loyal customers, 70% of whom became repeat customers. Additionally, about a third of customers went on to refer other customers.
While most businesses attempt to cultivate customers on Lagos Island, Quacktails found some of their most enthusiastic customers and referrers actually came from the Lagos Mainland
They iterated on their product quickly. They initially assumed that the choice of base spirit (gin, whiskey etc) would drive decision-making, but from careful observation, they realized that the flavour profile (sour, sweet, spicy) had a greater influence on choice. They quickly updated their menu to organize the drinks by flavour profile, instead of by base spirit.
Haus co-creates apéritifs with restaurants
California-based direct-to-consumer apéritif brand Haus is collaborating with a number of American restaurants to co-create custom apéritifs that reflect each restaurant's culinary approach. 100% of sales go directly to the restaurant to support them during these challenging times.
For fans of these restaurants, this is a unique, exciting value proposition they're likely to be excited to support.

If you own a food business in Ghana or Nigeria, consider reaching out to local microbreweries, such as Tema's Django Brothers, and Abuja's Bature Brewery, to co-create unique experiences for your customers.
Mission Taco goes private label
Mission Taco Joint, an American restaurant chain, adopted a similar model. With affordability in mind, they partnered with a distillery, and designed a private label drink that fit their flavour and cost profile.
Photo: Mission Taco's Private Label Drink
For restaurants, private label drinks are a creative way to leverage your brand to create special experiences your customers will love. They're also a good way for your customers to stay connected to your brand while supporting your business.
Sell cookbooks
Restaurants and food businesses have a wealth of intellectual property locked up in menus. Cookbooks are an evergreen revenue stream that allows your most passionate fans to deepen their relationship with your brand.
Dishoom's magical Cookery Book
Shortlisted for the Waterstones Book of the Year 2019 award, Dishoom's From Bombay with Love is an incredible example of a restaurant-authored cookbook.
Photo: Dishoom Cookery Book by APE
Dishoom, which has eight locations in the UK, is inspired by the old Irani cafés of Bombay. The restaurant enjoys a passionate community of fans who stand in long queues for a taste of the restaurant's bold, spicy flavours. With the Dishoom Cookery Book, fans are able to revisit over 100 classic Dishoom recipes even while the dining halls are closed.
Beyond the recipes, the book shines with Dishoom's characteristic quirky wit, with maps, travel guides, and historical photos of the city to which the restaurant pays homage. One customer described it as 'A love letter to Bombay told through food and stories' and another described it as 'Part travel guide, part history, part food manual, this reads like a personal diary with a stonking recipe collection as a bonus.'

Dishoom has been forced to close its doors due to the pandemic. Unable to offer dining room service and unable to make delivery and pickup work, Dishoom's Cookery Book has become a financial lifeline for the restaurant.

The Pandemic Pack - a joint cookbook by 16 restaurants
In Wellington, New Zealand's capital, 16 local food businesses brought an interesting twist to the cookbook idea. They jointly published The Pandemic Pack Collaborative Cookbook, an 86-page cookbook with 41 recipes from all the participating restaurants and cafes.
Photo: The Pandemic Pack Collaborative Cookbook
Where Dishoom published a paperback cookbook, The Pandemic Pack is an ebook, which makes it more affordable, and faster to bring to market. The restaurants also made it available at a pay-what-you-can price while recommending a base price of 10 NZD. All proceeds from the sales are then split between the contributors.

MESSAGE FROM THE PANDEMIC PACK: thank you everyone for your orders today ❤️ We have to make some changes, we’ll let you know what they are soon. WELLINGTON YOU ARE THE BEST ❤️❤️❤️ . . #PandemicPack #FoodDelivery #Wellington #OwnerOperator #NewZealand #SmallBusiness #LocalBusiness #SupportLocal #NZEats #NZFood #Coronavirus #CoronavirusNZ #CoronavirusWellington #Covid19
A post shared by The Pandemic Pack (@pandemicpack) on May 1, 2020 at 12:48am PDT
While it might be very difficult for you to publish a physical cookbook during the pandemic, consider publishing an ebook either solo or jointly with other food businesses in your community. Whatever you do, definitely take a leaf from Dishoom's book, and let your brand shine through.
Offer a meal subscription service
Subscription plans are a great way to lock in recurring revenue and provide convenience to your customers.
Photo: Plated Convenience
South Africa's Plated Convenience, a fresh food company, does this well. Customers subscribe to a 7 to 30-day plan, pay once, and Plated Convenience receives their payment in advance and as a lump sum.
How to set up subscriptions
If you're a food business owner in Ghana and Nigeria, you can set up a subscription plan using Paystack, in a few easy steps. Every week, or every month, or at whichever cadence you specify, your customer is debited automatically, and you get paid.
Set up automatic recurring billing in 5 mins
Paystack lets you set up automatic recurring billing without a line of code.

Become a butcher's shop
This strategy is similar to pivoting to grocery sales, and it works for food businesses that sell food that's made from meat, poultry, and fish. If your food business fits this profile, you can borrow a few ideas from restaurants such as H20 at the Hilton Pensacola Beach, and El Che Steakhouse & Bar.
 			Photo: El Che Steakhouse & Bar 		
H20 at the Hilton Pensacola Beach is a Florida-based restaurant attached to the Hilton Hotel. They got the idea to start selling beef when Omar Torres, H20's Executive Chef, decided to sell out their Wagyu beef stock at a discount to avoid waste.
In 30 minutes, they had sold out, so they ordered even more beef and produce from their suppliers. This simple yet effective pivot has made it a win-win for everyone — the suppliers, whose demands from restaurants had dried up, are now selling more, the restaurant is keeping staff on the payroll and boosting sales, and customers get access to rare and premium beef cuts at a significant discount.
Similar to H20, El Che, a Chicago-based restaurant with Argentinian influence, made a similar pivot. They collect beef orders, put customers on a waitlist, and then reach out to the customers for pick up once they're stocked up.
If you're a food business owner in Nigeria that sells beef, poultry, or fish-based meals, you too can adopt this model, leverage your supplier relationships, and invite customers to place orders online for delivery, or for drive-by pickup.
Pivot to grocery sales
Fusian is a 10-year old, Ohio-based sushi chain with 10 locations. In March 2020, when the government asked all restaurants in the state to shut down, their operations came to a complete halt. This was until one of the founders had the idea to turn their stores into a part-time grocery delivery service.
 			Photo: Fusian 		
Why it makes sense for restaurants to sell groceries
With many grocery stores experiencing long queues and running out of stock, restaurants can leverage their relationships with their own produce suppliers to serve as an alternative grocery location. Restaurant suppliers are also eager to meet this need because many of the restaurants they supply have shut down.
In some cases, the lockdown left restaurants sitting on large supplies of perishable produce that was at risk of spoiling. Instead of throwing the produce away, they were able to rescue the situation by selling the produce directly to customers.
Restaurants often source extremely high-quality produce and cuts that might not be easily available from traditional supermarkets or grocery stores. Customers are excited by restaurant pantries because they know they'll get great deals on very high quality produce.
Frisch's Big Boy, a US-based restaurant chain, also leaned into restaurant pantries in a big way. They opened up 100 out of their 120 locations, rebranded them as Big Boy's Markets, and invited locals to shop for everyday grocery items. Like Fusian, they leveraged their relationship with their suppliers to stock their locations. They also made it possible for people to order their groceries online.
Photo: Frisch's Big Boy
Over in Canada, Earls Kitchen and Bar is doing same. Across its 68 locations, Earls is selling grocery bundles at various price points (from $30 to $99) available for pickup and delivery.
As a food business, you might have access to restaurant-grade ingredients and products that people can't usually find. Think Fusian's organic tofu, for example, or King's Seafood's aged top-grade steaks. These rare offerings and competitive prices make restaurants-turned-grocery stores attractive to many buyers.
In some other cases, the lockdown left many restaurants with large piles of supplies they were unable to sell-off. King's Seafood, a 75-year old, USA-based premium seafood and steak chain had this challenge, and they simply converted one of their stores into a grocery store and invited locals to shop. The pivot was such a hit that they've kept the operation running.

Offer family and group meals
Schools around the world are closed, leaving parents attempting to navigate a high-wire act of working from home while taking care of children. Smart restaurants are meeting the specific needs of families by offering family-sized portions on their delivery menus.
Photo: Lazy Dog Restaurant & Bar
Families love it because they enjoy volume discounts when making relatively large orders, and there's been such a surge in demand for family-sized meals that restaurants that don't sell them are leaving money on the table.
Lazy Dog added five family meal plans to their menu to meet this demand. Each pack serves four to five people, and for every family meal a customer buys, they donate a meal for free.
Consider throwing in a few photocopied colouring pages in each meal pack for the kids. This gives parents a tiny extra reason to purchase from you over another restaurant.
Restaurant suppliers can supply directly to customers
When the effects of COVID-19 broke out, many restaurant suppliers saw a sharp decline in orders from restaurants and a spike in orders from everyday home cooks. A few of these suppliers leaned into the trend and made their products more retail-friendly.
Burlap & Barrel sells spices directly to customers
Photo: Burlap & Barrel
Burlap & Barrel, a New York-based spice supplier experienced this same phenomenon. First, they saw their orders from restaurants crash. They then experienced a dramatic increase in orders from two home cooks.
To meet the demands of this new type of customer, they made two significant changes.
Burlap & Barrel source for spices from more than a dozen countries. To hedge against delays and production backlogs as a result of the global lockdown, they increased the size of each order
Chefs tend to cook in large quantities and add spices with a large spoon. Home cooks, however, typically sprinkle spices. When Burlap & Barrel started selling more to home cooks, they perforated the tops of their spice containers so their new customers could sprinkle away!
Similar to Burlap & Barrel, if your food business primarily supplied restaurants and bars before, explore the possibility of selling directly to consumers by making a few strategic changes to your product.
Sell custom condiments online
Many restaurants serve specially made condiments to go with their meals. Examples close to home include the amazing green pepper sauce you enjoy at Accra's Front/Back or the bottle of shito sauce you can add to your order at most Chicken Republic outlets in Nigeria.
These condiments are usually popular with customers, and if you're a restaurateur in Ghana or Nigeria, there's an opportunity to package, market, and sell these condiments online.
But first, how do you package the condiments?
Packaging your condiments
The way your packaging looks can be just as important as how your condiments taste. Glass jars are a great way to package most condiments, so here are suggestions for two glassmakers in Ghana and Nigeria you can partner with.
Packaging Supplies (Ghana)
Glass Bottles NG (Nigeria)
Selling your condiments online
If your restaurant is already listed on a food ordering platform like Jumia Food, you can add your condiments to the list of available products.
Otherwise, consider using a simple tool like Paystack Payment Pages to sell your product online.

Sell gift cards
Selling gift cards is one of the more popular ways food businesses around the world are trying to stay afloat. The premise is simple — a customer buys a gift card today, and sometime in the future they exchange the card for products or services at your establishment.
Here's why many food businesses are selling gift cards
Since the pandemic began, gift cards have been a way for food businesses to immediately raise cash and keep operations running
Selling gift cards could also be a form of marketing. When customers buy them and gift them out, the recipients experience your brand, possibly for the first time, and you get an opportunity to convert them into repeat customers
Important things to keep in mind
Gift cards are effectively a type of no-interest microloan. They can work...as long as multiple customers don't attempt to cash in their cards at the same time. In the United States, some restaurants have halted gift card sales entirely due to the concern that selling gift cards is a short-term bandaid that only delays the pain. Some are also concerned about what would happen if they go out of business and their fans are left with gift cards that can't be redeemed.
As if that weren't enough of a headache, in the United States, escheat laws carefully regulate what happens with unredeemed gift cards. It's important to find out if similar laws exist in your country.
YES! No one talks about escheat laws! If a gift card is unredeemed, THE BUSINESS CANNOT JUST KEEP THE MONEY! And these laws differ from state to state!

— Brian Fitzpatrick (@therealfitz) May 6, 2020
If you take this path, it's important to do so with a clear-eyed understanding of the risks.
How to make and sell your gift cards
As an alternative to physical gift card, you could create a simple design with Canva, a popular design tool. Here're several free and customisable gift card templates on Canva you can choose from.
Once customers pay for your gift cards online, you can send them their gift cards via email or WhatsApp. When they come to redeem their cards in the future, they simply show you the gift card from their phones, and you check their names against your record.

If you're a Ghanaian or Nigerian food business owner, you can sell gift cards directly on your website or a Paystack Payment Page.
If your business is in Nigeria, you can also list them on a third party gift voucher platform such as Suregifts. To get started, simply reach out to their team via any of the following channels, and inform them you'd like to list your food business:
Email: hello@suregifts.com.ng
Phone: +234 (0)809 118 9900

It's free to list your business on the platform, and the Suregifts team designs the graphic that appears on your gift card too.
Teach cooking classes online
Food businesses, chefs, and cooking instructors are taking to the internet to host paid cooking classes.
Photo: Mike Greenfield on Teachable
Mike Greenfield, co-host of a popular YouTube cooking, show leveraged his popularity and expertise to start a paid cooking class on his personal website, and on Teachable, an online platform where people pay to learn new skills. On both websites, he teaches home cooks how to bake sourdough from start to finish.
Photo: Airbnb Online Experiences
Airbnb Online Experiences also lists several cooking classes hosted by cooking instructors from all over the world. Each cooking class is a practical and immersive session where participants learn everything from making Japanese Mochi to Portuguese Tapas.
There are several other platforms such as Udemy, Skillshare, and Instructables, where cooking instructors host their classes. Like Teachable and Airbnb Online Experiences, these platforms often charge a small percentage of each instructor's earnings in exchange for hosting and marketing their classes.
Consider leveraging your expertise by offering paid courses that allow people to level up in the kitchen.
Make hand sanitisers from your distillery
South Africa placed a ban on alcohol sales when the lockdown was introduced. The alcohol industry came to a halt overnight, and many distilleries were left with a large stockpile of alcohol. Because hand sanitisers have an alcohol base, several liquor companies such as Inverroche, a popular artisanal gin brand, made a quick pivot to start producing hand sanitisers instead.
In Inverroche's case, they had to apply for special licenses that allowed them to be recategorised as an 'essential business,' and they were soon underway to turn alcohol into sanitisers.
Amass, a USA-based distillery, also leveraged their know-how and access to alcohol to make sanitisers. They put a hold on their vodka and gin production and committed to producing 15,000 bottles of hand sanitisers.
Photo: Amass
If you own a small distillery in Ghana or Nigeria, chances are that you have easy access to alcohol and the know-how to produce hand sanitisers. This might be a good opportunity to drive sales and to contribute to the fight against this pandemic.
Offer concierge services
To create work for employees, several businesses are offering concierge services where they collect grocery lists from customers and help them shop, for a fee.
The team at All Together Now, a Chicago-based restaurant, is one of the many businesses that launched a version of this business model. In their case, customers call them for wine and cheese recommendations, and they go out to get it for them.
Food businesses are ideal for this because they have strong relationships with different suppliers, so they know where to quickly get many types of items.
How to transition your food business online in under 30 mins
If you're thinking of taking your food business online, and you should, we wrote a comprehensive guide that shows you how, in clear and detailed steps.
How to transition your business online
This is a comprehensive guide to everything you need to go to start selling online.
Start selling online →
Bringing it all together
A lot of the ideas in this guide fall into one of three themes — aggregating demand, going online, and building direct relationships with customers. Let's take a closer look at each theme.
Band together and aggregate demand
There's strength in numbers. When you partner with other businesses in your community, you're able to leverage each other's strengths to reach more customers, sell more, and hold each other up. We already saw how 16 food businesses in Wellington came together to publish the Pandemic Pack Collaborative Cookbook.
Australia offers another example of food business owners supporting each other. Popular baker Alisha Henderson (she goes by @sweetbakes_ on Instagram) rallied the professional baker community around the hashtag #cakemailaustralia, where they could highlight their goods by tagging it with this tag. She drove her community to the hashtag and highlighted some of the best entries on your Instagram Stories.
And in Ghana, Thrive Together offers yet another incredible example of community in action. It's a community of independent Ghanaian brands who have come together under one banner to not only survive the pandemic but to thrive beyond it.
During this period, it is critical to join forces with other businesses in your community to aggregate demand. Don't go at it alone.
Bring your business online. That's where your customers are.
Without an online presence, your business is limited only to customers who walk through your doors. Taking your business online immediately removes geographical barriers because customers from almost anywhere in the world can purchase from you.
To go online, you could start by creating simple Facebook and Instagram pages and pairing them with a Paystack Payment page, so customers can find you, and also pay you. You could also set up a website, and integrate it with Paystack. Here is a comprehensive overview of how to do this.
Build a direct relationship with your customers
The food businesses who have the best chance of making it through this challenge are those who have invested in building a deep relationship with customers.
While social media platforms like Instagram and Facebook are important, it's even more important to maintain a contact list of all your customers. A customer's phone number and email address mean you're able to give them a sense of an ongoing sense of how best they can support you.
This is yet another area where collecting payment online works better than cash: by default, every online transaction automatically builds up your database of customers and their contact information. During moments of crisis such as right now, that contact list is gold.

What types of businesses are eligible to apply?
We'll prioritise businesses that sell essential goods and services such as food or medical supplies. We'll also prioritise businesses that have a financial need that prevents them from getting the technical help they require.

The design, custom development, and store setup of your business' website are, however, not included in this offer.
Do I need to already have a website?
You need a domain name and also a hosting or subscription plan to get started. The agencies we've partnered can get you setup with these if you don't already have them.
Can I apply if my business doesn’t sell essential goods and services?
Yes, but we'll prioritise businesses that sell essential goods and services.
Can I apply if I already have a Paystack account?
Yes, you may apply.
What are the types of eCommerce platforms I can integrate to?

Will the digital agencies keep maintaining my business’ website for free after the integration?
The agencies are offering their assistance with setup only. All additional services rendered by the agencies will need to discussed and agreed upon between you and the agency.

Introducing Transaction Lookup
You can now instantly find the Paystack Merchant responsible for a debit alert
Abdulrahman Jogbojogbo

On this page
Here's how it works
Is it safe?
Need any help?
Every month, Paystack processes over 10 million unique transactions for over 60,000 businesses such as Branch, Palmcredit, and MTN.
When you make a payment online to these businesses, you'll often receive a debit alert from your bank. Most debit alerts include the name of the merchant, but for various technical reasons, a handful of them might sometimes read 'Paystack Payments Ltd.'
There's little need for alarm. In the vast majority of cases, what this means is that you recently made a payment to a merchant who uses Paystack to collect payments. Sometimes, banks send the debit alerts very late, even many days after the transaction was made, which can cause some confusion.
We've built a simple tool that makes it easier to figure out which business debited you in such situations, called Transaction Lookup.
Here's how it works
 			Say hello to Transaction Lookup 		
Using Transaction Lookup (paystack.com/lookup), you can securely submit a few details of the transaction, and we'll instantly show you the name of the business that debited you, as well as the exact date and time of the payment.
If you have further questions about the transaction - or if we're unable to find the transaction using the details you provided - you'll be able to quickly alert our Customer Success team to look into it for you with a few clicks.
Try Transaction Lookup
If you receive a debit alert from 'Paystack Payments Ltd,' use the Transaction Lookup tool to find out the business responsible for the debit.
Take it for a spin →
Is it safe?
We go to extreme lengths to ensure that the information you share with us is safe, so every single card detail you enter is securely transmitted to our systems.
We're also a PCI DSS Level 1-certified organisation (the highest certification possible in the world) and we take security and your safety extremely seriously.

A quick intro to online payments
Unlike cash, or face-to-face bank transfers, Paystack allows you to accept online payments from your customers however, whenever, and from wherever they want to pay — Lagos, Accra, Kano, or New York. It doesn’t matter.
 			The Paystack Checkout Form 		
Your customers can pay you with:
Card (Local and international debit and credit cards)
Bank (No card? No worries, customers can pay you with just their bank account numbers)
MobileMoney (Customers in Ghana can pay you via their mobile money wallets)
USSD (Customers can pay you with USSD codes such as GTB’s popular 737)
VisaQR (Your customers also have an option of scanning an auto-generated QR code with their phones to pay you)
It’s all very easy. If you'd like to see exactly what your customers will see when they try to pay you, you can try a demonstration for yourself here: paystack.com/demo/checkout
Once a customer pays you, you instantly see the balance on your Paystack Dashboard, which you can access from your phone or a computer. Paystack then pays out all the payment you’ve received within 24 to 48 hours.
Security — How Paystack keeps you and your customers safe
Paystack processes well over 6 million transactions every month, and we go to extreme lengths to ensure that both our merchants and their customers are safe.
We are a PCI DSS Level 1-certified organization (the highest certification possible in the world) and we take security extremely seriously.
How Paystack keeps you safe
What happens behind the scenes when you pay online with Paystack, and how exactly do we keep you secure? Let’s find out.

Pricing — how much does it cost to collect payments online?
Payments companies like Paystack only make money when you do. We charge a small fee on top of the transaction amount. Here's where you can find the most up-to-date prices we charge businesses in Nigeria and Ghana: paystack.com/pricing
How to create a Paystack account
It’s free to create a Paystack account, and you can do everything — start to finish — in less than 30 minutes. Here’s how:
Go to dashboard.paystack.com/#/signup
Enter your business details, such as business name, address, etc.

1. Payment Pages
Payment Pages are literally the easiest way to accept payments with Paystack. And you don’t even need a website to create or use a Payment Page. With a few clicks, you can create a simple, high-converting page through which your customers can pay you.
Here's a quick example of what a simple Payment Page looks like: paystack.com/pay/demo
Think of a Payment Page as an online equivalent of a shop: you sell products A, B, C, and you want your customers to walk into your shop, see the prices, and then select and pay for what they want.
It’s the same way with Payment Pages:
First, you create the shop in minutes (the link will be something like paystack.com/pay/your-business-name)
Next, you put the products on your shelves by uploading product details prices.
Finally, you sell. Once you create a Payment Page, you can start sharing the link with potential customers via WhatsApp, Facebook, Instagram etc. They'll click on your link, see what you're selling, and pay for what they want
If your business sells something that customers buy often, you can even set up recurring payments on your Payment Page, such that you can charge them automatically for as long as you provide a service to them. You can learn more about Subscriptions in the next section.
The following video walks will show you a visual walkthrough of how to set up a Payment Page.
Here're some additional resources for getting set up with Payment Pages
Here's a detailed explainer of the Payment Pages interface →
Here're some ideas for how different kinds of companies use Payment Pages →
Shareable Takeaway
Paystack Payment Pages are the quickest way to get started with online payments
 					Share on WhatsApp 				 					Share on Facebook 				 					Share on Twitter 				
2. Subscriptions (Automatic recurring payments)
Imagine receiving money on a recurring basis from your customers, automatically, without needing to lift a finger. Paystack's Subscriptions lets you set this up in a few clicks.
Say your business sells and delivers food to customers. You could set up a subscription plan with Paystack where your customers are automatically charged once a week. This is good for your business because you’re able to lock in revenue, and because your customers simply wake up and see their food at the door, without thinking about payments every single time. If once a week is too frequent for you, you can set up monthly, bi-annual, or even an annual subscription plan.
Whatever it is your business sells, ask yourself: 'Is there a way to turn this into a subscription?' There probably is!
Here’re a few resources to help you learn more about Subscription plans on Paystack:

Shareable Takeaway
Set up subscriptions (automatic recurring billing) in only a few clicks, with Paystack
 					Share on WhatsApp 				 					Share on Facebook 				 					Share on Twitter 				
3. Invoices
Using Paystack Invoices, you can request for payments from your customers directly. You simply log into your Paystack Dashboard, enter the person’s email, the name of the item they bought, the price, and hit send.
 			A sample Paystack Invoice 		
The invoice is automatically shared with the customer via email, but you can also share a link to the invoice via WhatsApp, Instagram, or wherever you talk to your customers.
Once your customer clicks on the invoice, it takes them to a page (similar to the one in the screenshot above.) When they click on 'Pay Now,' it takes them straight to the Paystack Checkout Form where they can immediately pay you!
Here's a detailed guide on how to create invoices. If you prefer video, the video below will show you to send invoices quickly.
Shareable Takeaway
Get paid faster with digital Invoices. You can send one in a few clicks with Paystack

How to quickly integrate with eCommerce platforms like Shopify, WordPress, Squarespace, and Wix
Payment Pages are a simple way to get started, but if you need more extensive features, you might want to consider eCommerce platforms such as Shopify, Wix, or WordPress.
Paystack has a wide range of plugins that allows you to integrate with these platforms in literally seconds.
In just a few clicks, you can start to accept payments using Paystack on popular platforms such as Shopify, WordPress, Wix, Squarespace, Magento, Opencart, Prestashop, Joomla, and several others!

Connect your customer data to all your other business tools
Selling online is only the first part of running your business. When you accept payments with Paystack, you’re able to leverage the payment data to do so much more.
Here's a practical example: say you wanted to send a personalised thank you email from an email marketing tool like Mailchimp to every customer that buys from you and also record every sale made through Paystack into the Wave accounting tool. You could do this using Paystack's Zapier integration to Mailchimp and Wave.
Using Zapier, here're some Paystack connections you can immediately try out:
Connect Paystack to Wave: You can record every sale made through Paystack into the Wave accounting tool.
Connect Paystack to Mailchimp: You can automatically add all new customers into Mailchimp. You can then send these customers broadcast emails, as well as add them to automated upsell campaigns.
Connect Paystack to Slack: You can send details of successful or failed transactions to a Slack channel.
Connect Paystack to Google Sheets: Say a customer's transaction failed, you could send details of the failed transactions to a Google Sheet so your team can follow up with customers.
Connect Paystack to Hubspot CRM: You can add new customers to your Hubspot CRM, and manage customer relationships better.
Connect transaction and customer data to your other business tools

Introducing UBA and Sterling Bank USSD payment channels
Your customers can now pay you using United Bank for Africa's *919# and Sterling Bank's *822# payment channels.

How Pay with USSD works
The benefits of collecting USSD payments via Paystack
Pricing
Need any help?
As a business owner, it's important to be able to collect payment from customers however they prefer to pay you. This is why we're always working to increase the number of payment options available to your customers.
We're excited to announce the introduction of two new payment options on the Paystack Checkout form. Customers can now pay Nigeria-based merchants using the United Bank for Africa *919# and Sterling Bank *822# USSD channels.
This means customers in Nigeria now have the choice of three bank options within the Pay with USSD channel: Guaranty Trust Bank, United Bank for Africa, and Sterling Bank.
How Pay with USSD works
Once a customer of any of the three available banks selects their bank option, they'll see the special USSD code they'll need to dial into their phone. Doing this will trigger an automated USSD sequence which will guide the customer through authorising the transaction from their bank account.
How to enable UBA *919# and Sterling Bank *822# collections
If you already have USSD enabled as a payment channel in your Paystack Dashboard, you don't need to do a thing - UBA *919# and Sterling Bank *822# have already been enabled for you.
To confirm that you have USSD enabled, kindly visit the Preferences page of your Paystack Dashboard, and look at the 'Accept payments via' section. If USSD is checked, your customers will be able to pay you via GTB *737#, UBA *919#, and Sterling Bank *822#.
The benefits of collecting USSD payments via Paystack
In addition to high transaction success rates, all USSD payments processed through Paystack enjoy the benefits of being captured on the Paystack Dashboard, including harmonized financial reporting and exports, granular user permissions so that different members of your team can access transaction data, the ability to quickly issue refunds or manage disputes, and much more.
Pricing
These new payment channels have exactly the same pricing as all other payments channels - there's no change in pricing. Kindly see the Pricing page for up-to-date pricing info.

Paystack + MemberPress: Accept subscription payments for your membership business

Installing the Paystack for MemberPress plugin
Common Questions
One of the most popular plugin requests we receive is for MemberPress — a WordPress plugin that lets you collect subscription payments and control access to content on your membership website.
We're excited to announce that the Paystack for MemberPress plugin is now live!
Collect recurring payments for your premium content
Say you run a website with 2 tiers of visitors — those on a free plan, and those on a paid plan. Using MemberPress on WordPress, you can show these 2 groups of people different types of content.
Here're some ways Paystack merchants like you use the Paystack for MemberPress plugin.
A news website
News websites sometimes offer different types of news articles — articles for users on the free tier, and then exclusive articles for customers on a monthly subscription.
Using the Paystack for MemberPress plugin, news sites can collect this subscription payment, and also automatically unlock exclusive content for readers on the paid tier.
A job recruiting website
Say you run a job recruiting website which features 3 types of jobs:
Entry level jobs — accessible by non paying users
Manager level jobs — accessible by users on a pro tier
Director level jobs — accessible by users on a platinum tier
Using the Paystack for MemberPress plugin, you can charge pro and platinum tier users different subscription amounts, and manage their access level.
Installing the Paystack for MemberPress plugin
Here're instructions for how to install the Paystack for MemberPress plugin.
Common Questions
Here's a list of common questions we get from businesses looking to use this plugin.
Can I accept international payments using this plugin?
Yes, you can. All you have to do is enable international payments from your Paystack Dashboard. Here's how to enable international payments →
Can I use it to accept one time payments?
Absolutely!
Other than the Paystack for MemberPress plugin, are there other plugins which can help me accept membership payments?
Yup! Check out the Paystack Gateway for Paid Memberships Pro.
Can my customers opt out of their subscription plan if they choose to?
Yes, your customers can opt out at anytime if they choose to.

✨ NEW: Reset your API keys from the Paystack Dashboard
Business owners can now change their API keys directly from the Paystack Dashboard.
Abdulrahman Jogbojogbo
Product Marketer, 					Paystack
On this page
Why this matters
How to Reset your API Keys
Important things to note
Questions?
Every time a customer attempts to pay you, or when you initiate a transfer, your business sends a special set of IDs called API keys to Paystack behind the scenes. Paystack reviews these API keys, and confirms that they truly belong to your business before enabling the payment or transfer. 
Previously, if you wanted to reset your API keys, you'd need to send an email to the Paystack support team. We're happy to share that you can now issue new API keys to yourself from the Paystack Dashboard.
Why this matters
Anyone who has access to your API keys can collect payments on your behalf, or do transfers from your Paystack account.
Now imagine your API keys were compromised — say you mistakenly share them with someone, or a bad actor gets their hands on them. You can now immediately change your API keys, and take back full control of your business.
Additionally, depending on the type of your business, it may be good practice to periodically change your API keys, say twice in a year. This strengthens your security against bad actors.
Now, how exactly do you reset your API keys?
How to Reset your API Keys
Log into your Paystack Dashboard
Click on the Settings page, and then click on the API Keys & Webhooks tab
Just below your Live Secret Key, you’ll see the option to generate a new secret key. Click on it
4. After you click on it, you’ll be prompted to select when you want your old API keys to expire
5. Finally, you’ll be required to enter your password to generate your new secret key!
Important things to note
1. Only Admins can change a business’ API keys
2. When you change your API keys, you’ll need to update your business’ website, app, or servers with the new keys to continue accepting payments or making transfers on Paystack
3. The wait period allows you to schedule a specific time in the future when the current keys will expire. Let's say you selected the 30 minutes wait period, for example. What this means is that for the next 30 minutes after you select the option, both your old API keys and new ones will be active. Immediately after the 30-minute mark, however, the old keys will stop working, and only your new keys will work
4. Every change you make to your API keys will be recorded on your Audit Logs.

What is Zapier?
Zapier Basics
Tutorials — How to use the Paystack Zapier integration with 5 types of business tools
Got questions?
We're excited to announce our early access integration with Zapier, an automation platform that helps you connect Paystack with over 1,500 apps, including many of the business tools you use everyday such as Mailchimp, Slack, Wave Accounting, Google Sheets, and more.
With Zapier, you can pipe transaction and customer data from Paystack to your business tools in a few clicks, without writing a single line of code.
Please note: This is an early access integration with Zapier, which means that it's a relatively small release with the primary goal of understanding how people use the integration. This will inform future updates to the integration.
In this post, I'll walk you through how to automatically:
send transaction info to your accounting tool (Wave)
add new customers to your email marketing tool (Mailchimp)
alert your team about every sale (Slack)
add new customers to your customer relationship management tool (Hubspot CRM)
send payments info into to your shared spreadsheet tool (Google Sheets)
Let's jump right in!
What is Zapier?
Zapier helps you become more productive by automating day to day tasks, and helping you automatically take action, and pipe information between business tools.
Say you wanted to automatically add every customer who makes a purchase on Paystack to your email marketing tool, or you wanted to automatically log all successful transactions in a shared spreadsheet, or you wanted to automatically populate your CRM. With the Zapier-Paystack integration, you could set up all of these, and a whole lot more!
Zapier Basics
First, please create a free account on Zapier.
To understand how to use Zapier with Paystack, it's important to understand the concept of Triggers and Actions. Let's break it down.
Suppose you connected Paystack to Mailchimp so that every new customer is added to the email marketing tool. In Zapier parlance, the Trigger, in this case, would be 'new customer,' while the action would be 'add new customer to Mailchimp.'
For this Early Access release, you can use two Paystack Triggers on Zapier:
New Transaction Trigger: this causes something to happen every time there is a successful or failed transaction on Paystack
New Customer Trigger: this causes something to happen every time a new customer is created on Paystack
These triggers let you connect Paystack to the other tools you use in very useful ways. Do you want to update your CRM with the details of new customers? The New Customer Trigger lets you do this. Want to keep an eye on all successful and failed payments? The New Transaction Trigger lets you do this.
Tutorials — How to use the Paystack Zapier integration with 5 types of business tools
I'm going to show you detailed, step-by-step video instructions on how to connect Paystack with some of the most popular business tools, without writing a single line of code.
There’re are 1,500+ tools on the Zapier platform to choose from, but in these tutorials, we’ll show you how to connect Paystack to five of them:
Wave (accounting tool)
Slack (team collaboration tool)
Mailchimp (email marketing tool)
Google Sheets (shared spreadsheet tool)
Hubspot CRM (customer relationship management tool)

How to connect Paystack to Wave with Zapier
In this tutorial video, we'll show you how to automatically record every sale made through Paystack into the Wave accounting tool.
If you use other accounting tools such as Xero, you can use a similar process to connect Paystack using Zapier.
How to connect Paystack to Mailchimp with Zapier
In this tutorial, you'll learn how to automatically add all new customers into Mailchimp. You can then send these customers broadcast emails, as well as add them to automated upsell campaigns.
If you use other email marketing tools (such as Drip), you can use the same process to integrate Paystack with those tools.
How to connect Paystack to Slack with Zapier
In this tutorial video, you'll learn how to send details of successful transactions to a Slack channel.
How to connect Paystack to Google Sheets with Zapier
Sometimes, customer transactions fail for reasons such as the customer having insufficient funds, or mistyped OTPs. In this tutorial, you’ll learn how to send details of failed transactions to a Google Sheet so your team can follow up with customers.
You can also pair Paystack with other spreadsheet apps such as Microsoft Excel and Airtable.
How to connect Paystack to Hubspot CRM with Zapier
Hubspot CRM helps businesses manage their customer relationships. In this tutorial, you'll find out how to add new customers to your Hubspot CRM.
If you use other CRMs such as ZohoCRM or Agile CRM, you can use a similar process to send new customers to those tools.

How to get USD settled into your Zenith Bank accounts
Have any questions?
In 2018, we announced USD settlements, which enable Paystack merchants to list their goods in USD, and get paid and settled in USD. Today, we're excited to announce Zenith Bank as a new addition to the bank options for USD settlements.
 			Adding a Zenith Bank account as your USD settlement bank account 		
How to get USD settled into your Zenith Bank accounts
Firstly, you'll need a Zenith Bank domiciliary account to be able to get settled in USD. (If you don’t have one, this short guide from Zenith Bank explains how to get started.)
If this is the first time you’re adding a USD settlement bank account to your business on Paystack, follow these steps:
1. Log into your Paystack Dashboard
2. Click on Settings
3. Click on the Bank Accounts tab
4. If your business doesn't yet have international payment enabled, you'll need to request for international payment to be enabled.
5. Once international payments are enabled for your business, navigate back to the Bank Accounts tab. You'll see a new row for USD bank accounts. Click Add bank account, select Zenith Bank from the dropdown of bank options, and add your USD domiciliary Zenith Bank account number.

If you’d like to change your existing USD payout bank account, navigate to the Bank Account tab and click 'Change bank account' on the USD row.
Have any questions?
If you have any question at all about USD settlements in Zenith Bank accounts (or international payments generally) please feel free to send us an email at hello@paystack.com - we’re very happy to help!",blog

How much does a billboard cost in Lagos? (2019 Pricing Guide)
Everything we learned while mounting Paystack's first billboards in Nigeria's commercial capital
Abdulrahman Jogbojogbo
Product Marketer, 					Paystack
On this page
In August 2019, we put up our very first billboards in Lagos, Nigeria's commercial capital. In this post, I’ll outline everything we learned at Paystack about billboard advertising in Nigeria. I'll also share a detailed pricing guide for all steps of the process.
Why did we decide to put up billboards?
Every day, thousands of people encounter the Paystack Checkout Form for the first time. While many of them go ahead to complete the payment (we process over 6 million payments a month), many more hesitate. This is because Nigeria is a relatively low-trust environment, and online payments are still relatively novel.
We frequently hear from merchants that one of the biggest business challenges they face is this question of trust. During community events, our customers explained to us that while people are growing used to paying online, a lot of prospective customers reach out to them seeking assurance that nothing bad will happen if they pay online.
'Can you help educate customers that online payments are secure?'
In response to this, we decided to do something we've never done before - an out of home campaign with two goals.
Goal #1: To educate everyday people about the many safeguards in place to protect them when they pay online.
Goal #2: To make our merchants' customers more familiar with the Paystack brand, so that they recognize (and trust) the brand when they encounter it on our merchants' checkout forms.
The Paystack logo is a promise of safety and speed, and we wanted our merchants’ customers to feel secure when they see 'Paystack' on checkout forms. And so began our very first experiment with traditional outdoor advertising, and a not-so-traditional microsite.
Selecting an ad agency in Lagos
When we started thinking about billboards, we had no idea how to approach this, so we looked for an outdoor advertising agency who could help guide us.
We contacted and reviewed the billboard portfolios of about 30 agencies in Lagos, and whittled the list down to 7 companies.
Here’s a public database of the final 7 outdoor advertising companies. It lists
Photos of all their billboard locations
Pricing for all their billboards
Contact information
Website info
After reviewing these agencies, we partnered with XLBillboards, an outdoor ad agency based in Ikeja, Lagos. Several factors such as the locations, types, and costs of their billboards led to our decision to choose them.
Shareable Takeaway
Here's a database of recommended billboard agencies in Lagos. Includes pricing, contact info, and photos of the billboards.

Drawing up a contract with the agency
Sometimes, ad agencies won’t proactively provide a contract for the engagement. You may request for one, or simply create one, and share with them. 
In our case, it was important that we have a proper contract, so I worked with our Legal team to create one. Here’s a template for the Service Level Agreement (SLA) we shared with our outdoor agency →

How much did our billboards cost?
A number of things count towards the cost of a billboard in Lagos
Rent costs
Printing costs (if it's a static billboard)
A fee paid fo the Advertising Practitioners Council of Nigeria (APCON)
The cost of a single billboard can vary wildly from ₦160k (~$450) to ₦2.5 million (~$7,000) a month depending on these factors, as well as the billboard location and type.
We spent exactly ₦5,039,750 (about $13,900) for two billboards for three months. Here’s the cost breakdown:
Billboard 1 - located at Ahmadu Bello Way, Victoria Island, Lagos
Rent (3 months) = ₦2,000,000
Printing costs (4.6m by 14.5m) = ₦105,000
Sub-total = ₦2,105,000 (~$5,800)
Billboard 2 - located on top of the Ikeja Plaza building
Rent (3 months) = ₦2,625,000
Printing costs (5.4m by 36m) = ₦225,750
Sub-total = ₦2,850,750 (~$7,860)
Vetting costs
APCON fees = ₦84,000 ($230)
GRAND TOTAL = ₦5,039,750 (~$13,900)
(Do you put up billboards often? What do you think about how much we spent? Did we get a good price, or did we overpay? Let us know at hello@paystack.com!) 
Shareable Takeaway
This is exactly how much it cost Paystack to put up two billboards for 3 months each.
 					Share on WhatsApp 				 					Share on Facebook 				 					Share on Twitter 				
Choosing the billboard type
We needed to decide whether to go for a static billboard, or a digital one.
Static billboards are the traditional option, where you mount a printed fabric for a fixed amount of time. Digital billboards, on the hand, can display multiple images in a short period of time and can also display other media types such as video and animation.
Each billboard type comes with its pros and cons. Here’re the factors that informed our final choice to go with static over digital.
Some advantages of static billboards:
With a static billboard, we wouldn’t be sharing a space with any other brand. It would 100% be ours, day and night, till our rent expires, while with digital billboards, our ad would only be displayed for about 8 seconds at a time, once every 64 seconds.
Static billboards are a lot more affordable compared to digital billboards.
Some disadvantages of static billboards:
If we decided to modify our ad mid-campaign, it would require lots of effort to do this on a static billboard. It's a lot easier to update a digital billboard because there're no printing costs.
Static billboards only display static content, unlike digital billboards, which can display animated content such as videos.
Considering these pros and cons, we chose to share our message on static billboards. We wanted a dedicated billboard space to ourselves for as long as our rent was running, and we knew that it was highly unlikely that we'd want to change our ad mid-campaign.

Choosing the billboard locations
We evaluated dozens of locations before choosing the two we went with: one location on the Lagos mainland, and another on the island.
The mainland billboard was located on Mobolaji Bank Anthony Way. This is a high traffic area which leads to Computer Village, a very popular market where people purchase electronics such as laptops, phones, come get their electronics fixed, and more. We assume that the proximity to Computer Village will expose the billboard to people who're slightly more familiar with technology, and that this group a lot more likely to encounter a Paystack checkout form, and slightly more likely to be willing to try out online payment.
The island billboard was located on Ahmadu Bello Way on Victoria Island. It's one of the major entry points to the island for many people who live in Surulere, Apapa, Mile 2, Ijora, and along Ikorodu Road.
Designing the billboard
We went through multiple design iterations over the course of many weeks before hitting on a design we were super pleased with.
One of the most challenging parts of the design process was deciding on the copy which would be displayed on the billboard. We needed something which was short enough to read quickly (the billboards would be displayed along busy highways) while also driving home the core message of the campaign - security.
We ultimately hit on 'Pay safe. Pay fast. Paystack' It's only a few short words, which makes it easy for the eye to scan, and there's something about the rhyme that helps it linger in the ear.
Here's how the design progressed.
This was a very first attempt to visualize the idea and make some decisions about narrative, placement and colour. The hand is a repeating motif in various aspects of our brand expression and it makes another appearance here. We decided there were too many elements at play.
The introduction of the singular illustration on the right hand side helped with structure. The halo around the card was meant to signal an idea of a shield, but when we presented the image to people we found that most people didn't get it.
We started to wonder if we were emphasizing the message of security enough. This took us down the path of exploring having more descriptive text. We also bumped up the size of the URL because we were going to create a bespoke interactive experience at that link and wanted people to notice it.
We quickly realized that more text made the billboard way too wordy. Since the billboards were going to be displayed against busy highways, the message needed to be succinct enough for someone speeding in car to get it in a few sentences.
We missed the simplicity of 'Pay safe. Pay fast. Paystack.'
We went back to the original copy and explored a different strong visual element, in this case a mouse cursor hovering over a large pay button. This felt too cold. The Paystack brand is a promise of warmth, and this felt like it was too much about the machine and not enough about people.
A hand completing a payment on a mobile phone provided the perfect balance between introducing a human element, while also signalling the link to technology.
Now that the main elements were done, we explored colour and a few finishing touches.
One last round of revisions to draw more attention to the URL. We ultimately went with the hand emoji because we currently use a lot of emojis in our brand communications, and it fit in well in context of the mobile phone (most people use emojis in the context of mobile messaging)
 			Final design of the island billboard 		
 			Final design of the mainland billboard 		
And here're the final designs above!
You'll notice two differences between the assets - different dimensions, and different URLs.
The different sizes were because the billboards had different dimensions, and we displayed different URLs because we wanted to track if there was a difference in traffic between the two locations.
Creating the microsite
The billboards are part of a broader campaign to assure everyday people about the safety of online payment.
To compliment to the billboards, we created an interactive microsite - paystack.com/security - which takes customers behind the scenes and explains what happens when they pay online. 
The site will live beyond the billboard campaign, and our hope is that the next time a customer asks a Paystack merchant whether its safe to pay online, the merchant will simply send the Secured by Paystack page to the customer to help build trust.
Instead of a wall of text, we opted for an interactive, animated experience which invites the visitor to insert themselves into the narrative. We're betting that this engaging experience will incentivize more people to read through to the very end.
The site also allowed us to leverage numerous testimonials we've received from both merchants and their customers as a form of social proof.
While the primary URL of the site is paystack.com/security, we created two additional variations of the URL to display on the billboards. The reason we did this is because we're curious to see how traffic differs between both locations. Early results show that the mainland billboard is driving six times the number of views as the island billboard.
Shareable Takeaway
In an A/B test of two billboard locations in Lagos, the Paystack mainland billboard drove 6 times as many website views as the island billboard location

APCON Billboard Vettting
APCON is the Advertising Practitioners Council of Nigeria. According to their charter, they’re dedicated to 'promoting responsible and ethical advertising practices in Nigeria.'
By law, they review every outdoor ad before brands can publish and promote them. This helps to ensure that ads shown to the public aren’t misleading or offensive. Only registered advertisers can submit ads for vetting, so we worked with our partner ad agency to share the design with APCON for approval.
APCON has a publicly accessible Vetting Guideline that explains what they look out for. Some of the major red flags that could get your ad rejected include:
copy that includes profanity
making false or exaggerated claims
featuring non-Nigerian models (if it did, we’d have had to make a case for it, and also pay an extra ₦500,000 vetting fee.)
We had 2 slightly different versions of our ad, so we submitted both via our partner ad agency to APCON for vetting. There’re 3 vetting options to choose from:
Regular vetting (2 weeks): ₦25,000 per ad
16-hour expedited vetting: ₦150,000 per ad
8-hour expedited vetting: ₦280,000 per ad
For our billboards, we chose the 2-week vetting option, and paid 50,000 NGN for both variations of our ads to APCON. Additionally, we paid a service charge to our partner ad agency for rendering this service to us.
Shareable Takeaway
All billboards in Nigeria must be approved by the Advertising Practitioners Council of Nigeria. The approval fee costs between ₦25,000 to ₦280,000 per ad, depending on the turnaround time.
 					Share on WhatsApp 				 					Share on Facebook 				 					Share on Twitter 				
Printing the billboard
Both billboards were printed on flex material using a 10 foot-long Challenger flex banner printing machine.
For really large prints such as ours, the printing press, Poster Print Limited, first split our ad design into smaller sections in a process called tiling.
For the 36m long billboard, for instance, the design was split into 12 tiles which were printed separately. After a 4-hour printing process, all 12 tiles were then sewn together, and transported to the billboard site.
Because of the continued exposure to harsh weather, the billboard's flex materials are subject to wear and tear. To minimise damage, it’s important that your ads are printed on high-quality flex material. In our case, we used the 550 grams specification.
Shareable Takeaway
When a billboard design is sent for printing, it's printed into distinct units in a process called tiling, and then the different parts are sewn together.
 					Share on WhatsApp 				 					Share on Facebook 				 					Share on Twitter 				
Mounting the billboard
The billboard on Ahmadu Bello Way was mounted on a unipole, while the one on Ikeja Plaza was mounted on a tall building’s roof slab.
On average, the process of mounting takes about 5 hours to complete, but in the case of the 36m long billboard in Ikeja, it took about 12 hours because the workers were interrupted by heavy winds.
Conclusion
I hope this overview of our first experience with billboard advertising was helpful!

Details of the Paystack outage on August 9, 2019
An explanation of the root cause of the August 9 outage
Ezra Olubi
Co-founder & CTO, 					Paystack
On this page
Root cause and how we fixed it
Prevention and follow-up
Conclusion
On Friday 9 August 2019, services that work to power Paystack's transaction processing experienced elevated errors. This started at about 11 pm WAT on Thursday 8th August and was mostly resolved by 6 pm WAT on Friday 9th August, with a handful of intermittent issues lingering until 10 am WAT on Monday 11th August. The duration and degree of errors and timeouts varied considerably from service to service and is explained below. A detailed description of the failures will be discussed in a future blog post.
Customers may have experienced increased latency (i.e. an abnormally long period to get responses from the product) and intermittent errors. This resulted in some customers not receiving a receipt and/or value right after being debited.
We apologize unreservedly to our customers whose services or businesses were impacted during this incident, and we're taking immediate steps to improve the platform’s performance. Internal teams are meeting regularly, performing a full post-mortem to understand how this occurred and how we prevent this from ever occurring again.
Root cause and how we fixed it
This was a major outage, both in its scope and duration. As is always the case in such instances, multiple failures combined to amplify the impact.
During the lifecycle of a transaction request on Paystack, several messages are generated and pushed to queues. This helps ensure that our response times stay very low. These message queueing systems play significant roles in our infrastructure, including automating event broadcasting, delivering receipts to our customers, and the use of different available transaction processing failovers.
Around 11:10 pm WAT on Thursday 8th August 2019, we started observing an abnormal rapid rise in our transaction failure rates.
Upon further investigation by our Engineering team, we were able to trace the issue to a failure when attempting to post to one of our messaging systems. This was triggered by a yet-to-be-discovered fault in the image being used by our instances.
By 4:00 pm WAT on Friday, our engineers pushed an update to temporarily stop queueing messages, concluding every required step in the same API call. Later, we deployed a script to send receipts and events for successful transactions concluded during the downtime.
Prevention and follow-up
While we have rerouted traffic away from the failing dependency, we have also begun a dialogue with our messaging service provider to pinpoint why this occurred.
We’ve also started looking at ways to have failovers in our messaging system architecture to resolve this single point of failure and make it more resilient, including implementing fallbacks to handle the message calls in the event of failures like this in the future.
We're performing an ongoing post-mortem process at Paystack to ensure we fully understand what went wrong, what we could have done better, and identify steps to eliminate the possibility of this happening in future.
As we learn more, we'll share a follow up with more details of our findings as well as what additional measures we're taking.
Conclusion
Every day, billions of Naira worth of value hurtles at lightning speed through Paystack, on behalf of some of the most ambitious companies in Africa. It is a responsibility we take absurdly seriously.
Most days, this complicated dance happens seemingly effortlessly, but it takes a day like Friday to remind us of how many people rely on us to come through, flawlessly, every day, without fail. We measure a downtime like this not only in currency, but in the many thousands of friends we let down.
This was an upsetting situation for our customers and our team. We're embarrassed that this happened, and are committed to making this a profound learning experience. We're deeply sorry for the negative impact this had on our customers, and are putting in place all possible changes to ensure that something like this doesn't happen again.
Thank you sincerely to the many thousands of companies who rely on Paystack to power your growth. We strive to be even more worthy of your trust, every day.",blog

What is a Paystack Payment Page?
How to list multiple products on your Payment Page
Use Case: 📦 Online store
Use Case: 🎺 Event ticketing
Managing product inventory on your Paystack Dashboard
Developer documentation — Build custom inventory management solutions
Have questions or suggestions?
We're excited to introduce a much-requested enhancement to Paystack Payment Pages. You can now list multiple products on your Payment Page, manage product inventory on your Paystack Dashboard, and your customers can now quickly purchase multiple quantities at a time.
What is a Paystack Payment Page?
Payment Pages are literally the easiest way to accept payments with Paystack. With a few clicks, you can create a simple, high-converting page through which your customers can pay you. Payment Pages are popular with merchants who want a quick way to collect payments from multiple customers, or merchants who don't have their own website.
You could previously only list a single product on a Payment Page at a time, and customers could only purchase one quantity at a time. Now, we're excited to expand the functionality of Payment Pages to serve more use cases.
How to list multiple products on your Payment Page
It's really easy to list multiple products on a Payment Page
First, go to the brand new Products section of the Paystack Dashboard and create as many products as you like. You can include the product descriptions, price, and the number of units you have in stock.
Next, create a Paystack Payment Page and add one or more products from the list of products you created
Share your custom link to the Payment Page with your customers. Customers will be able to buy multiple units of multiple products for as long as products are in stock.
Here's a super detailed guide on how to list multiple products on Payment Pages, complete with helpful screenshots.
Here’re a few interesting ways we’ve seen businesses use Products on Payment Pages.
Use Case: 📦 Online store
Say you have lots of followers on Instagram and it's your primary platform for acquiring paying customers. You can now add a simple link to your Instagram bio that takes customers to a Payment Page listing every product you sell.
As customers purchase from your store, you can go to your Paystack Dashboard to see how many units of each product you've sold, which customers paid for which products, and your total sales per product.
Use Case: 🎺 Event ticketing
Products on Payment Pages are a great way to sell event tickets online. Simply list different ticket types (eg. regular vs VIP tickets), and your customers will be able to purchase multiple quantities at a time.
You can set the number of tickets, so that as soon as the last seat is sold, the page shows an 'Out of Stock' message.
Managing product inventory on your Paystack Dashboard
Your Paystack Dashboard now includes a simple inventory manager. Set the quantity of each item and track inventory in real time, track revenue per product, and see a list of everyone who has paid for each product.
 			You can set the inventory for every product you sell 		
The screenshot below shows a book seller's inventory on their Paystack Dashboard. It lists all the books they sell and the quantity of each book left in stock. This provides a quick way to tell when you're running low on stock.
 			A bookseller's inventory on the Paystack Dashboard 		
You can also drill deeper to see detailed sales information per product. The screenshot below shows more information about The Mouse and the Stone, one of the books in the bookseller's inventory. You can see the number of units of this book she has in stock, the number of times the book has been sold, and a list of customers who've bought the book.
 			Sales information about a product 		
For businesses that sell more than one product, Products on Payment Pages are a great way to track how well your products sell, and make sure you're always in stock on the products your customers want.
Developer documentation — Build custom inventory management solutions
If you're a developer (or have access to developers), you can build custom solutions on top of Products on Payment Pages!
Check out the developer documentation for Products on Payment Pages →
You’ll find 5 API endpoints that’ll show you how to create, list, fetch, update, and add products to Payment Pages.

Summary
In late 2018, a friend sent me a screenshot of a warning he received from Gmail when he opened an email broadcast from Paystack - a large yellow banner carrying the words 'Be careful with this message.'
 			Gmail warning an email recipient about a Paystack email 		
Gmail was warning our email subscribers that our emails might be harmful, and it was immediately clear that our open rates and email deliverability could suffer as a result.
In this article, I’m going to share in detail everything we learned while fixing this. If you're ever in a similar situation, this post should help you resolve it for yourself.
Understanding Email Sender Reputation
I did several Google searches to understand the problem, and quickly realised that:
It was hard to find a single guide that explained everything I needed to do from A to Z
Email Sender Reputation significantly influences email deliverability
An Email Sender Reputation is a score, usually between 0 - 100, that Email Service Providers (ESPs) such as Gmail, Outlook, and Yahoo Mail assign to organisations that send out emails. The higher the score, the more likely it is that ESPs will deliver emails to subscribers’ inboxes.
The lower the score, the more likely it is that when you send broadcast emails, many of those emails will either get caught in subscribers’ spam folders, or not get delivered at all.
We monitor our reputation score with Sender Score's look-up tool. Check your email sender reputation.
Shareable Takeaway
An Email Sender Reputation score is a score assigned by Email Service Providers such as Gmail and Yahoo Mail to email marketers. The lower the score, the more likely your emails will end up in spam.
 					Share on WhatsApp 				 					Share on Facebook 				 					Share on Twitter 				
A lot of factors contribute to the reputation score, but the important ones all have to do with how subscribers engage with your emails. ESPs listen for both positive and negative engagement signals to increase or reduce a sender’s reputation score.
Examples of positive engagement signals include:
a high open rate - your open rate is the percentage of people that open your email compared to the number of people who received the email
a high click-through rate - the click-through rate is the percentage of people who click on a link in your email, compared to the number of people who received the email
subscribers forwarding your emails to other recipients
Examples of negative engagement signals include:
a very low open rate
subscribers reporting your emails as spam
a high unsubscribe rate
inclusion of your domain name in email blacklists (more on email blacklists later)
a high hard bounce rate - the percentage of emails that don’t get delivered because they were sent to invalid email addresses
a high soft bounce rate - the percentage of emails that don’t get delivered because they were sent to subscribers with full inboxes
A checklist for improving your email deliverability and sender reputation
Here’re the actions we took to improve our Email Sender Reputation, and by extension, our deliverability. We'll dive into each one in detail.

Authenticating our email sending domain
Email authentication helps an organisation prove that emails claiming to come from them are actually authorised by the organisation.

Before we authenticated our emails, our subscribers' Email Service Providers - sometimes called Mail Transfer Agents (MTA) - couldn't tell for sure that emails claiming to come from a paystack.com email address were actually coming from Paystack. This is one of the reasons why Gmail was sending our subscribers the warning on the large yellow banner.
After we authenticated our email sending domains, our subscribers’ ESPs could verify authorship of Paystack emails on our subscribers’ behalf, and help us get the emails delivered into the right mailboxes.
On a high level, this is how email authentication works: we add a bit of information to all our emails, and then add a corresponding bit of information to a publicly available directory that everyone can see, but only someone from Paystack can access. Now, when we send out emails, our subscribers' ESPs can verify the authenticity of the emails by checking the bit of information in the email against the publicly available directory for a match.
The main ways to authenticate emails
There are several ways to authenticate emails, but the 3 most important ones, and the ones we implemented, are:
Sender Policy Framework (SPF) - an authentication method that lets our subscribers' ESPs verify that an email claiming to come from paystack.com is indeed sent by an IP address, or domain authorised by us
Domain Keys Identified Mail (DKIM) - an email authentication method that lets our subscribers' ESPs verify that the server claiming to have sent the email is indeed who they claim they are. Since modern email servers use secure email sending protocols, this also implies that the content of our emails didn't change in transit and that we take credit for the content of the emails. As a pair, SPF and DKIM are effective authentication methods that complement each other. SPF only allows us to declare authorised senders, while DKIM helps to verify the identity of senders claiming to be authorised by us.
Domain-based Message Authentication, Reporting and Conformance (DMARC) - this authentication method allows us to indicate that our emails are protected by SPF and DKIM. It also instructs ESPs on actions to take when an email claiming to come from us fails one or both of SPF and DKIM - should our subscribers' ESPs accept, reject, or quarantine these emails? At Paystack, we set our DMARC record to quarantine emails that fail SPF, DKIM, or both. Lastly, DMARC lets us set up an email where reports of emails that pass or fail our email authentication are sent to. This allows us to review and modify our policies while identifying false positives and false negatives.
Shareable Takeaway
The 3 most important email authentication methods every email marketer should adopt are SPF, DKIM, and DMARC
 					Share on WhatsApp 				 					Share on Facebook 				 					Share on Twitter 				
Setting up email authentication
The two things I needed to be able to authenticate our emails were:
Access to the DNS Server for our email sending domain
Access to Drip, the tool we use to send broadcast emails
Authenticating Paystack’s email domain required some technical work, so I worked with our engineering team to make it happen. Here’s a breakdown of the steps we took:
STEP 1: We copied Drip's SPF record, which is:

v=spf1 include:sendgrid.net ~all

Important: your email marketing tool will likely have a different SPF record
STEP 2: Our marketing automation tool, Drip, sends emails using Sendgrid, so we needed to get the DKIM record from Sendgrid, which is something like:

v=DKIM1; k=rsa; p=really-long-public-key

Important: your email marketing tool might have a different SPF record. Please refer to your email marketing tool's Help Desk for help on how to get the specific SPF and DKIM records for that tool. If you use Drip, you can find detailed instructions here.
STEP 3: The engineering team updated our DNS with our SPF and DKIM records
Important: If your organisation sends out emails using different tools, please include the different SPF and DKIM records of all those tools in one record and not as separate records. Sometimes, some ESPs are not smart enough to check for other SPF and DKIM records after they see the first ones. This may lead to some of your emails not getting delivered.
For example, here's the preferred SPF record format:
v=spf1 include:sendgrid.net include: domain1.net include: domain2.net ~all

It contains the multiple SPF records for sendgrid.net, domain1.net and domain2.net all in one line.
Here's an example of an SPF record that some ESPs might have trouble with: 

v=spf1 include:sendgrid.net ~allv=spf1 include:domain1.net ~allv=spf1 include:domain2.net ~all
This format contains different SPF records in multiple lines, and some ESPs might not know to check lines 2 & 3 causing some of your emails to not deliver.
STEP 4: I shared our preference for how ESPs should treat emails that fail one or both of SPF and DKIM with our engineering team, and they translated it into a DMARC record that looks like this: 

v=DMARC1; p=quarantine; rua=mailto:dreports[at]paystack[dot]com; pct=100
The DMARC record above instructs all ESPs to quarantine ('p=quarantine') 100% (pct=100) of emails that fail one or both of SPF and DKIM, and send pass or fail reports to the email 'dreports[at]paystack.com (rua=mailto:dreports[at]paystack.com)
STEP 5: The engineering team updated our DNS record with our DMARC record
Authenticating Paystack’s email domains contributed significantly to our improved email sender reputation, and ultimately, our improved email deliverability.
Sometimes, we use Global Cyber Alliance's free lookup tool to check the status of our email authentication. Try Global Cyber Alliance's free lookup tool for yourself here.

Removing Paystack’s domain name from email blacklists
An email blacklist is a real-time database of domains that are believed to be sending emails considered to be spam or fraudulent. There are more than 100 known blacklists, and ESPs routinely check for domain names on some of the lists to update their reputation scores for the domains. I discovered that our paystack.com domain had somehow been listed on 20 email blacklists.

(I should mention immediately that we handle customers' emails with the highest standards, and as I describe later, simply authenticating our domain immediately removed us from the blacklists.)
📝 Important: Please note that not all blacklists are credible - a few are fraudulent. When I was searching through blacklists, I found one that listed Paystack’s sending domain, and asked for payment to delist our domain. No credible email blacklist will ask you to pay to get delisted. Instead, they’ll provide a clear list of action items designed to have you following email sending best practices.
How do blacklists work?
Here’re the 2 most popular ways blacklists add domains to their list:
Spam traps - blacklists often operate a large number of active emails that have never subscribed to an email list before and inactive emails that should have stopped receiving any emails. If your organisation sends large amounts of emails to these trap emails, you risk being added to a blacklist
Feedback from subscribers - some blacklists also listen for feedback from subscribers. If subscribers keep reporting you for sending unwanted emails, or not honouring unsubscribe requests, you also risk being added to a blacklist
In order to find the blacklists where we were listed, I first searched through aggregated blacklist lookup platforms (tools that search about a 100 blacklists at a time). Here’re the ones I used:
UltraTools Domain Blacklist Check
MX Lookup
Next, I checked our domain against some very popular blacklists by hand:
Spamcop
Spamhaus
Invaluement
SURBL
Barracuda
Removing Paystack’s domain from the blacklist
I found that by simply authenticating Paystack’s email sending domain, we were excluded from all the blacklists that previously listed us. In your case, however, your email sending domain may have been included on a blacklist for other reasons, and email authentication might not get you off the hook.
Here’s a general workflow for delisting your email domain from an email blacklist:
Get help from your technical team to ensure that your email server is correctly configured, and your email domain is authenticated
Follow the recommended blacklist removal process - some blacklists will tell you why you’ve been listed and give specific instructions that’ll get you delisted
Check to see if the blacklist allows self-removal. If it does, be sure to fix the identified issues, and then remove your organisation’s sending domain. It’s pretty straight forward the first time, but it gets more difficult if you get blacklisted subsequently
Some other blacklists give clear instructions that’ll get you delisted, and then routinely do sweep checks to list new domains or delist some existing ones
Removing Paystack’s sending domain from blacklists was an important step in improving our email deliverability.
Shareable Takeaway
Being listed on an email blacklist affects your reputation score, because ESPs routinely check those blacklists to determine whether to deliver emails you send from your domain
 					Share on WhatsApp 				 					Share on Facebook 				 					Share on Twitter 				
Pruning our email list
After a while, it's natural for a percentage of your email subscribers to stop opening your emails. When this happens, the email list is said to have partly decayed. We've created an email pruning workflow that removes our least engaged subscribers from our email list.
Why do we prune our email list?
You might be asking 'It takes a long time to grow a large email list. Why on earth would you willingly delete email addresses from your list?!' There’re 2 main reasons why we prune our list:
To improve our sender reputation - When a significant percentage of our subscribers don’t open our emails, it drives down our engagement numbers which in turn affects our email sender reputation. Since a percentage of subscribers will inevitably churn, if you don't prune your list, those inactive subscribers start to account for a larger and larger percentage of your entire email list. For example, if 20 out of 100 subscribers open our emails - that’s an open rate of 20%. When we prune our email list to say, 80 emails - 20/80 would net an improved 25% open rate, which would slightly improve our reputation score. Removing subscribers who're no longer engaged, therefore, ultimately improves our email deliverability.
To reduce cost - like many email marketing tools, Drip's cost is determined by the number of emails in our account. The more the emails in our list, the more expensive it gets. Without realizing it, our email list had grown very large with many inactive addresses. So proactively identifying and removing inactive subscribers saves us a lot of money.
Shareable Takeaway
Over time, some part of your email list decays. Removing your least engaged users helps improve your email sender reputation and email deliverability, and also saves cost.
 					Share on WhatsApp 				 					Share on Facebook 				 					Share on Twitter 				
How we prune our email list
The longer it’s been since a subscriber opens an email from you, the lower the chances of them ever opening another email. This is an inevitable 'law' of email marketing. Depending on the industry, what qualifies as an engaged user varies. At Paystack, we default to a conservative 90 day period of inactivity before drawing subscribers into a re-engagement campaign.
Here’s how I found our '90 days' number:
I queried our email list with this condition: 'show me the number of subscribers who haven't opened our email in the last 10 days'
I then increased the inactivity period by 10 days at a time till I got to 150 days
At first, the corresponding number of subscribers dropped sharply as the inactivity period increased but the drop started to steady and I found that after a point, the number of inactive subscribers remained flat.
Let's break this down with sample numbers and a simple graph.

(Please note that these numbers are not real - they're sample numbers for the purpose of this demonstration.)

 			Number of inactive subscribers vs inactivity period 		
From this graph, it’s clear that after 60 days of inactivity, a subscriber that doesn’t open an email from the sender will likely never open one again. This is a safe method for determining the cut off point for email lists.
Now to the actual 'how' - how exactly did we prune our list? At Paystack, we use Drip to automate our email marketing efforts, so I designed and activated a 'pruning workflow.' Here’s what the workflow looks like:
 			Unsubscribe workflow 		
For this workflow, we only bring in subscribers who haven’t read the past 10 emails or opened a Paystack email in the past 90 days. We apply a 'quarantine' tag, which we use to exclude these email address from subsequent broadcasts (in case they're simply tired of hearing from us), and we wait for 30 days, after which we draw them into a re-engagement campaign that encourages them to choose their email subscription preferences.
 			Subscribers to the Paystack email list can choose email preferences 		
If they open one of the campaign emails and select their preferred email types, we keep them on our list and only send them the exact types of emails they opted into. Otherwise, we remove them from the Paystack email list.
Pruning our email list required some initial effort, but its benefits are long term and require little to no subsequent input. The pruning exercise improves open rates, as well as email deliverability.
Monitoring our email sender reputation metrics
We monitor key email metrics which help us detect fluctuations in our email deliverability, and take appropriate actions. Here’re the most important metrics we track:
Spam rate - This is a ratio of emails that subscribers mark as spam compared to the number of emails that were sent out
IP reputation - This gives a sense of how likely it is that an email client’s spam filter will mark our email as spam or not
Authentication - This shows the ratio of emails that pass SPF, DKIM & DMARC checks compared to the number of emails that attempted the authentication
There’re a number of tools that can help you monitor one or more of these key metrics. I’ve, however, found Google Postmaster Tools to be one of the most user friendly tools to use.
 			Google Postmaster Tool 		
Like you can see from the image above. we now score 100% across the three metrics - DKIM success rate, SPF success rate, and DMARC success rate.
📝 Important: Google Postmaster Tool won't provide data on emails that weren’t sent to a Gmail client, and that might be a downside for you if a significant percentage of your subscribers don't use Gmail.
Summary
I hope this post has provided a good understanding of everything we did to go from yellow banner to improved email deliverability!
To sum it up, here’re the action items that worked for us:
Authenticating Paystack’s email sending domain by setting up SPF, DKIM, and DMARC
Removing Paystack’s email sending domain from credible email blacklists
Proactively pruning unengaged subscribers from our email list
Monitoring key email metrics

During the program, Paystack will pay for membership to co-work spaces wherever students are, so that they have access to reliable electricity and internet with which to excel at the program.
After the program, students have the chance to be hired by Paystack, and we'll also introduce students to the many Paystack merchants (including many of the best companies in Nigeria) who're looking for development talent.

What is Lambda School?
California-based Lambda School trains people to be software engineers with live interactive classes, at no up-front tuition cost. Instead, students have the option to opt into an Income Share Agreement where they pay a fraction of their future income. This is no mere code camp, though.
Lambda School provides an immersive 9 month training in full stack web development, delivered via real-time online classes. The expert curriculum is designed and taught by instructors from Google, Apple, Blizzard, and many more from some of the best technology companies on the planet. In many cases, Lambda instructors literally wrote the textbooks others teach from. And if you get stuck at any point, there's instant, one-on-one help whenever you need it.
Lambda's quality of instruction is matched only by its strong focus on the employability of graduates. 86% of Lambda graduates are hired within 180 days of completing the program, and it's no exaggeration to say that the Lambda has quite literally transformed the lives of hundreds of people.
Lambda School launched about two years ago in the US, and recently opened its doors to students from the European Union. And now, in partnership with Paystack, Lambda School is accepting applications from for the first time from students in Cote d'Ivoire, Ghana, Kenya, Nigeria, and South Africa!

Why Paystack x Lambda?
Paystack and Lambda share a lot in common. We're both alumni of the Y Combinator Accelerator and we both raised funding from Stripe, the payments giant whose mission is to increase the GDP of the internet.
Most importantly, both Paystack and Lambda School are obsessed with figuring out how to give everyone the tools they need to build their dreams. While Lambda does this by removing barriers to a career-changing education, Paystack does this by providing growth and payments tools to help businesses in Africa scale. Although we come at it from different directions, we're united in our desire to amplify human potential, and we're excited to join forces to work together to do exactly that.

Next, click on 'Create A Plan' [1] to create a new plan
Click on the 'Interval' drop-down to select a plan interval [2]

You can now filter through your existing subscriptions using the subscription plan’s name, a subscriber’s email address, or the amount of the subscription. This feature helps you narrow down your subscriptions faster, especially when you only remember one detail about the subscription.
Here’s how to search for subscription plans by customer email address, plan name, and amount:
Log into the Paystack Dashboard, and click on 'Subscriptions'
To search by customer’s email address, enter the customer’s email in the email address text box [4]

Log into your Dashboard, and click on 'Subscriptions'
Select a customer’s subscription you wish to cancel

The road to ₦10 billion/month
Thank you
In mid-2017, we shared that for the first time, customers were using Paystack to pay over ₦1 billion in monthly transaction value to Paystack merchants. This is how that blog post ended.
You give us purpose, and we’ll need your support to help us reach our next milestone: ₦10 billion in monthly transaction volume 😎 Watch this space ✊🏿❤️
A year and three months later, we’re thrilled to announce that we’ve hit our next transaction milestone: customers are now using Paystack to pay over 10 billion naira (~$27.5 million) to Nigerian merchants, every month.
Shareable Takeaway
Customers are now using Paystack to pay over 10 billion naira (~$27.5 million) to Nigerian merchants, every month.
 					Share on WhatsApp 				 					Share on Facebook 				 					Share on Twitter 				
It’s worth noting that this figure doesn’t include the transaction value we process in global currencies, and doesn’t reflect what we process through transfers.
Making the case for digital payments to everyday people
In the nearly three years we’ve been building Paystack, one of the biggest lessons we continue to learn is that many everyday Nigerians are quite literally encountering digital payments for the first time.
If you’re blessed to encounter internet technology and startups every day, it can be hard to appreciate how new all of this stuff is to the average person. Every month, we see thousands of people who’re using their 'ATM Cards' online for the first time. 
And every month, we also see those same people go from taking their first hesitant, nervous steps into digital payments with one Paystack merchant, attempt more payments with other Paystack merchants as they gain confidence, until they’re racing into the new world of opportunity opened up by the convenience of digital payments.
And for our merchants, they marvel at the the speed with which their customers adopt digital payment channels when they offer them - even relatively newer payment options. A few months ago, we quietly enabled Visa QR as a payment channel. Within hours, and without announcing the new channel anywhere, we were stunned to see hundreds of thousands of Naira paid through that channel.
This is why these milestones mean so much to us. They help tell two stories: the story of Nigerian customers becoming ever more confident in digital payments, and the story of business owners who can do more - dare more - now that they can experiment with new business models, and reach customers all over the world.

How to put together a strong Y Combinator application
Free and useful resources for putting together a strong YC application

🤝 Building relationships with Developers 
✍🏾 Applying to YC
Y Combinator accepts some of the best founders from across the world into their accelerator program, and funds them through their early stages. Every year, for the past two years, Paystack has hosted the Y Combinator Lagos Meetup - an event where YC alumni share tips on how to put together strong YC applications with prospective YC applicants.
⚡️ Resources from the YC Lagos Meetup
Here’s a roundup of some of the most useful tips, and discussions from the last meetup that you’ll find useful:
A video recording of the entire Q&A session - Link to Q&A video
Paystack CEO, Shola, did a quick breakdown of how Y Combinator works, and you can find the slides here: Link to slides
A link to the livetweet thread of the entire Meetup - this Twitter thread has short notes from the event
🔥 Additional Resources for Prospective Applicants
Advice for African founders applying to Y Combinator, from African YC alums - Link to videos

A YC blog post highlighting the common misconceptions about applying to YC - Link to the article
Hackernoon’s collection of 60 sample YC applications, videos, interviews, and application advice - Link to the collection
🤝 Building relationships with Developers 
Y Combinator recommends that founders have at least one technical co-founder (read YC CEO, Michael Seibel’s tweets about this). At the last Lagos YC Meetup, several people expressed how hard it is for them to find technical people to work with, so we put together a list of a few places to meet and build relationships with good developers in Nigeria:
Devcenter - an active online community of developers
ForLoop is a network of in-person developer meetups. You can reach out to them via their website
Google Developer Group is one of Nigeria's oldest developer communities. You can contact them via their website
Payslack - an online community of developers in the Paystack Slack network
✍🏾 Applying to YC
Y Combinator receives applications into their program twice a year. They run the first batch from January through March, and the second one from June through August. To apply to Y Combinator, you just fill out an application form.",blog

NEW: Public beta of USD settlement
Paystack merchants can now list goods and get settled in USD

The processing fee
Any questions?
One of the most popular feature requests we receive at Paystack is for businesses to be able to list their products in USD, and get settled in USD. Well today, we’re excited to announce a public beta that’ll allow you do just that!
 			A Payment Page listing a product in USD 		
How does it work?
We’re currently running a pilot of USD settlement, meaning that we’re actively working to support more settlement banks and refine the process over time.
For now, you’ll need to have a Guaranty Trust Bank (GTB) Domiciliary account to be able to get settled in USD. (If you don’t have one, this short guide from GTB explains how to get started).
Next, you then link the GTB Domiciliary bank account to your business on Paystack. Here’s how:
Log into your Paystack Dashboard
Click on Settings [1]
Click on the new Bank Accounts tab [2]
Click on Add bank account on the USD row [3] 
Add your USD domiciliary GTB account number
 			A screenshot showing how to add a GTB domiciliary account to your Paystack account 		
Your USD bank account will be reviewed within 24 to 48 hours. Once this is done, you will be able to list your products in USD, your customers will be able to make international USD to your business, and Paystack will settle you in USD - easy!
How long before you get settled?
Paystack settles all international USD payments into merchants’ GTB domiciliary bank accounts 7 working days after customers pay. So, say a customer pays you in USD today, the amount paid will reflect immediately on your Dashboard, and you’ll get settled into your bank account 7 working days from today.
The processing fee
Paystack charges a processing fee of 3.9% per USD transaction.
Any questions?
If you have any question at all concerning international USD settlements, please feel free to send us an email at hello@paystack.com, or request a phone call - we’re happy to help!",blog

Improvements to the process of issuing multiple refunds
It’s now easier to manage multiple refunds on the Paystack Dashboard
Abdulrahman Jogbojogbo
Product Marketer, 					Paystack
On this page
Have questions?
We’ve made several improvements to the process of doing multiple refunds to the same transaction.
You can now see multiple refunds per transaction - when you process refunds in bits for a single transaction, you can now see all the refunds on the transaction’s page, and also see the status of the refunds (see the screenshot below)
From the transaction’s page, you can also click on 'Process another refund' as shown below to initiate a refund for part or all of the remaining amount the customer paid. So, if a customer paid you 3,000 NGN, and you had previously processed 500 NGN for refund, you may now click on 'Process another refund' to refund the remaining 2,500 NGN, or refund only a part of the remaining 2,500 NGN, say 750 NGN
When the transaction has been fully refunded, you will no longer be able to create a refund for that particular transaction, and the 'Process another refund' button disappears
Refund amounts are now suggested to you - at the point where you’re about to make a refund, the correct amount to refund is shown to you. In the illustration shown below for instance, 600 NGN out of 3,000 NGN has been processed for refund, the modal correctly suggests that you refund only 2,400 NGN

Improvements to Transfers

Improvements to Bulk Transfers
Have questions?
Improvements to Bulk Transfers
We’ve made a ton of improvements to Bulk Transfers that make it easier for you to transfer funds to multiple bank accounts at the same time.
1. It’s now a LOT easier to upload transfers. Previously, you could only bulk upload transfers if the headers of the CSV were in a very specific format. Now, you can upload any spreadsheet, and then select the correct headers after the upload. This means that you no longer need to wrestle with the CSV in Excel before bulk upload!
2. You can now review a bulk transfer spreadsheet after you upload it, and make edits by clicking on the pencil icon [7]
3. It’s now easier to identify duplicate transfers. When you bulk upload your list of transfers, duplicate lines are flagged, and you can click on the caution icon [4] to resolve this
When you click on the caution logo [4], a modal appears, and you can either click on any of the delete icons [5] to delete one or more duplicate, or ignore it by clicking on 'Ignore Duplication' [6]
If you choose to proceed and ignore the duplicates, the transfer is made to the same recipient multiple times
4. It’s now easier to see if you might be about to send a transfer to the wrong person. When you upload the transfers CSV, the Dashboard now automatically checks to see if the name of the customer you’ve supplied is the same name that’s associated with the bank account.  If there’s a mismatch (i.e. if it’s possible you were about to send a transfer to the wrong person) such as in [8] below, you will be notified, and given the option to:
Make edits to the bank account number or bank account name by clicking on the pencil icon as shown in [7] above
Make the transfers anyway to the owner of the bank account number
5. You can now retry failed transfers. When you make transfers, and some of them fail, you can now retry only the failed ones by clicking on 'Retry Failed Transfers' [9] You can also select specific transfers and retry only those.
Find transfers on the Dashboard with Transfer Code or ID
It used to be relatively difficult for businesses that do transfers via the Paystack API to find specific transfers on the Dashboard.
Now, this process is a lot easier, and here’s how you go about it:
Copy the Transfer Code of a particular transfer from your end
Login to your Paystack Dashboard, and click on 'Transfers'
Click on 'Go To Transfer' [1], and paste the Transfer Code in the 'Transfer Code or ID' field [2]
Click on 'Go' [3] to go to the particular transfer

We’re excited to announce a number of updates to the Customers and Transactions pages that’ll make it even easier for you to access useful information about your customers and transactions.
Here’re the new things you can do:
Export your details of your top customers
Filter customers by number of successful, abandoned, and failed transactions
Filter transactions by customer email address
Save your default filtering option
Export details of your top customers
Your top customers spend the most, or buy the most number of times from your business. We’ve made a simple update to the Insights page that lets you export details about your top customers for any given time period.
Here’s a list of top-customers details you can now export:
First name
Last name
Email
Phone number
Number of transactions
Total amount spent
Percentage of revenue (the percentage share of revenue that a particular customer has contributed to your business)
Created date (the date that each transaction is made)
To export your Biggest Spenders report:
Login to your Paystack Dashboard, and click on 'Insights' [1]
Scroll down to the Top Customers section of the page, and click on 'Biggest Spenders' [2]
Click on 'Download Biggest Spenders CSV' [3] to export your biggest spenders data to your computer
The downloaded report is a CSV file, and you can open it with any spreadsheet application such as Microsoft Excel, Google Sheets, or Numbers.
To download the Most Payments report:
Click on 'Insights' on the Dashboard
Scroll down to the 'Top Customers' section of the page, and click on 'Most Payments' [4]
Next, click on 'Download Most Payments CSV' [5] to download the report to your computer as a CSV file
Filter customers by number of successful, abandoned, and failed transactions

Sometimes, you want to find information such as 'customers who’ve had at least 2 abandoned transactions within the last 2 weeks.' The new filters let you do just that - filter through your customer list by the number of successful, abandoned, failed, and reversed transactions that customers have had within a time period. 
Here’s how to find customers with these filters:
Login to your Paystack Dashboard, and click on 'Customers'
Click on Filters [1] to show a list of filter options
Click on the first drop down [2] to filter by either 'at least' or 'exactly' a number of transactions that the customers have had
Click on the next dropdown [3] to select one of the following transaction types:
transactions (all the transactions)
successful transaction(s)
failed transaction(s)
abandoned transaction(s)
reversed transaction(s)
Click on the dropdown in the 'Date Period' section [4] to select the desired time range for which you want the report
Select the class of customers you want to generate the report for (new, returning, or all customers) [5]
Click on 'Filter' [6] to find customers that satisfy your preferred filtering options 
Filter transactions by customer email address
You can now filter through transactions on the Transactions page using customer email addresses. This feature helps you narrow down transactions faster, especially when you have only the customer’s email address.
Here’s how to filter by customer email address:
Log into the Paystack Dashboard, and click on 'Transactions'
Click on 'Filtered By' [7] to reveal a modal containing filter options
Type the desired customer email in the Customer ID/Email entry box [8]
Click on 'Filter' to filter your transactions list
Save your default filtering options
On the Transactions and Transfers pages, you can now save your preferred filtering options. By default, the Transactions page shows you a list of all successful transactions that your business has ever processed while the Transfers page shows you all the transfers that your business has ever done.
You can now change these default filtering options such that, by default, you see transactions or transfers that fit your custom filtering options!
Here’s how to set a default filtering option:
Click on Transactions on the Dashboard
Click on 'Filtered By' shown as [7] above, and select your preferred filtering options
Click on 'Save as default filter' [10] to save this option, and your Dashboard will always remember it, and serve you a transaction list that fits your custom search filter every time you log in to your Dashboard
To set a default filtering option for your Transfers page, click on 'Transfers', and follow the same steps above

This brings the total investment we’ve raised to date to a little over $10 million.
I’d like to share what this means for you, our customers, and for the future of our company.

Our next stage of growth
In 2016, we announced our seed round of $1.3 million to make it easier for businesses in Nigeria to get paid. Two years later, Paystack serves over 17,000 businesses, processing over 15% of all online payments in Nigeria. To put things in perspective, our monthly processing volumes have grown 30 times since we announced our seed round in Dec 2016.
We’ve introduced a steady cadence of innovations into the market, including recurring billing, automated chargeback resolution, and customer insights. And all this with a small but mighty team of 29 incredible people.
In 2018, we started to plan for what comes next. 
Our Series A will go towards building out our payment infrastructure even further and expanding across Africa. And as Paystack looks to expand rapidly across the continent, we’re thrilled to have the benefit of the deep expertise of Stripe, Visa, and Tencent.
Shareable Takeaway
Paystack will invest their Series A fundraise into deepening their payments infrastructure, expanding across Africa, and hiring talent.

In 2017, Bloomberg reported that half of Americans who bought something online in the past year did so from a business whose payment was processed by Stripe, while Visa - a household name - is a key part of the fundamental infrastructure that makes global commerce possible.
It’s no exaggeration to say that together, these companies are some of the planet’s most knowledgeable domain experts in payments, and we can’t wait to leverage their deep insight on behalf of businesses across Africa. We know that the payments problems on our continent is far from solved, but with this infusion of capital, and with backing from global payments leaders, we believe we’re in the strongest position to fix them.
As a Paystack merchant, you can expect accelerated access to technology that previously quite literally wasn’t available on the continent. You can expect local, regional, and global payment channels that make it ridiculously easy to get paid by customers anywhere in the world. And beyond payments, you can expect a whole suite of new tools to help you acquire, retain, and engage customers. 
In summary, Paystack’s next step is to become a complete growth engine for modern businesses in Africa, enabling new business models, and to be an amplifier helping you grow and scale.
Shareable Takeaway
Paystack merchants will benefit directly from the fundraise in the form of accelerated access to payments technologies, more payment channels, and new growth tools.

Why Paystack Exists
Paystack’s mission is to help businesses in Africa be profitable, envied, and loved. Today, we do this primarily through a modern payments platform that helps thousands of businesses accept online and offline payments quickly and securely.
Every week, our team collectively speaks to hundreds of business owners. These businesses - our customers - operate in a wide number of industries, and at different scales, from airlines and telcos, to Instagram stores and side hustles. But every single one of them is eager for growth, and Paystack exists to provide them the tools to run and scale massively successful businesses.
Hearing the stories and dreams of our customers inspires me everyday. We all know that building a business in Africa is hard, but it is also increasingly clear that there’s a new generation of innovators who, against all odds, are building amazing businesses across the continent. We are obsessed with building the infrastructure and tools to allow them thrive.

Thank you
In our 2017 end of year review, we said:
Paystack shouldn’t exist.

Two geeks with no institutional backing and no formal financial training had no business sticking their nose into fintech. And yet here we are, two years later, held up quite literally by thousands of hands.
I look around and I marvel at the adventure that this has been. 
Paystack - the company, and the portfolio of phenomenal companies we serve - is a joyful rebuke against the idea that you must look a certain way or be a certain way to succeed in the world.
Thank you to everyone who has helped us hold up the flag for business in Africa. Thank you to existing investors who have been unwavering in your support. Thank you and welcome aboard to new investors who believe as intensely as we do in building bridges between Africa and the global economy. 
Thank you to my co-founder Ezra and our incredible team, who perform miracles daily, and who must now continue to write the rulebook in as many languages as there are on the continent. Thank you to the incredible African technology ecosystem that has supported us in ways too numerous to mention.

And above all, thank you, always and forever, to the 17,000 businesses who’ve entrusted us with your business. Words fail to describe the overwhelming appreciation I feel for you, and how much the Paystack team is rooting for you.
Our promise to you is that we’ll build the tools that will give you every opportunity to start and scale a business that is profitable, envied, and loved.
Thank you.

Onwards.

Coming Soon: The New Paystack Checkout Form
A first look at the brand new Paystack checkout experience, rolling out in August 2018

Every month, over 1,000,000 transactions are processed through the Paystack Checkout Form for over 12,000 business. Checkout is one of the most important touchpoints of the Paystack experience, and we’re thrilled to announce that the Paystack Checkout Form will be getting a major upgrade in the next few weeks.
Say hello to Paystack Checkout Form 2.0!
Shareable Takeaway
A new and improved Paystack checkout experience will be rolling out soon for over 12,000 business.
 					Share on WhatsApp 				 					Share on Facebook 				 					Share on Twitter 				
A Brief History of the Paystack Checkout Form (2016 - 2018)
In January 2016, Paystack went live with a simple Javascript file that anyone could put on their site to load a checkout form. The first version of the Checkout Form was designed and developed within a week, and updated incrementally over time.
Hundreds of thousands of customers have interacted with the first version of the Checkout Form, funneling millions of dollars worth of payments into the pockets of businesses in Nigeria. 
For the first year and half of Paystack’s existence, we supported only card payments. In mid-2017, we introduced a second payment channel, Pay with Bank. In 2018, we’ll be unleashing many new payment channels, ensuring that once a business integrates with Paystack, you’ll be able to unlock numerous payment options with only a few clicks.
When we started work on implementing new payment channels, we realized that our trusted tab design for the Checkout Form could only handle about two or three payment channels elegantly. As the number of people who use our checkout form increased, and as we needed to support more payment methods, it was time to take another stab at the Checkout Form.
We set to work.
Rethinking the Checkout Experience
While the original motivation for the new Checkout Form was to support new payment channels, we quickly realized that this was an opportunity to fundamentally rethink the checkout experience, while retaining the familiar elements that both merchants and customers have come to know and love.
If you designed an online checkout form specifically engineered for high conversions amongst Africans, what would it look like?
This is the question that Paystack designer/developers Ope Aikomo, Onyekachi Mbaike, and Olumide Ojo obsessed over. We broke this down into themed questions, including How will it handle multiple payments channels?, How will it inspire trust?, How will it drive better success rates?, and more. Here're the full list of questions that shaped our thinking.
Using this as a base, we started a 6 month-long process involving research, many (many) design iterations, development, and testing, and now we’re excited to share a first look at the new Paystack Checkout Form, which will be rolling out to all merchants in early August 2018.
This is what the new Checkout Form looks like with multiple Payment Channels.
 			The anatomy of the new Paystack Checkout Form 		
And this is what it looks like with only one Payment Channel.
 			Single payment channel. 		
As always, Paystack merchants will be able to select exactly which Payment Channels they want to enable for their business, and the design of the checkout will update to make sure it always looks great.
Shareable Takeaway
The new Paystack Checkout Form is the product of 6 months of research, design, development, and testing.
 					Share on WhatsApp 				 					Share on Facebook 				 					Share on Twitter 				
Completely rebuilt from the ground up
The new Paystack Checkout Form was completely rebuilt from the ground up with modern development tools and frameworks. One of the first things we did was create a foundation for this new product in the form of a Javascript library we call Paystack JS.
Paystack JS
Paystack JS is the foundation for our new checkout form as well as a nifty tool for developers across the Paystack network. With this library, developers and merchants can now design your own payment forms exactly as you wish. 

What this means is that developers can use Paystack JS to build an entirely custom checkout experience to look and behave exactly as you desire. In fact, the new Paystack Checkout Form itself is built on Paystack JS. Basically, if you’d prefer that your Checkout look and behave differently, you’ll be able to implement that.
We’ll be publishing the documentation for Paystack JS within the next few weeks, so prepare to hear a lot more about this.
As soon as this was done, we moved to design.
Design
We focused on making the checkout form simple but yet sturdy enough to support many more payment channels. Even with scale, we wanted it to feel as good - if not better - than the old one. Our design goals also included making it very accessible, and to provide a great mobile experience.
In future articles, we’ll share some of the design directions we explored.
Mobile Experience
70% of payments on Paystack are done on mobile phones, and so paying with Paystack has to be a pleasant experience on mobile. We increased text sizes for readability, fine-tuned transitions, and designed a unique layout that expresses our ideas for what paying on your phone should feel like.
Testing on the new checkout
We also made it much easier to use checkout while testing. Test information is readily available and easy to use so developers can focus on their code and logic.
New Payment Channels
The new Paystack Checkout Form sets the stage for brand new payment channels, including GTB 737, Ghana Mobile Money, and Visa QR code payments.
The vertical tab design means that the checkout form is future proof - it’s now extremely easy for us to add more payment channels as they come. And it doesn’t matter how many channels a business owner has turned on - whether you choose to display only a single payment channel, or all of them, the Checkout Form will still look great.
Smart Error Resolution
Paystack merchants enjoy the best transaction success rates in the industry, but failed transactions happen from time to time, and every customer who encounters a 'failed transaction' screen is a missed sales opportunity for our merchants.
There’re numerous reasons why a customer might run into a payment error. For example, the customer might have insufficient funds, or the customer’s bank might not have authorized that card for online payments.
Whatever the reason for the error, the new Paystack Checkout Form is smart enough to know WHY a customers’ payment failed, and then recommend alternative payment options to ensure that the customer successfully completes the transaction.
For example, say that the transaction is failing because the customer has insufficient funds in their account. The new Checkout Form will:
explain to the customer exactly why the payment failed
helpfully serve up alternate ways that the customer can complete the payment from other bank accounts
Shareable Takeaway
The new Paystack Checkout Form has tons of improvements, including more payment channels, smart error resolutions, improved mobile experience and more!
 					Share on WhatsApp 				 					Share on Facebook 				 					Share on Twitter 				
Much more coming down the pipeline
This is just the beginning. Here’s a peek at further enhancements we’re considering for later in the year.
Language Translations
Paystack merchants have customers from all over the world, and the best Checkout Form is one that speaks their language. If a customer is looking at the checkout form in Francophone Africa, for instance, the Paystack Checkout Form should ideally display text in French, while a customer in Madrid should see instructions in Spanish.

Closer to home, not everyone is fluent in English. A Yoruba, Igbo, and Hausa native speaker should be able to navigate the Paystack Checkout Form as easily as anyone else.
After-Purchase Actions
The moment right after a customer makes a successful payment is a high point in a merchant’s relationship with that customer. What if it were possible to leverage that magical moment to further help businesses drive their goals?

We’re considering a range of post-purchase actions that Paystack merchants can enable if they desire.
Click to share product: Prompt customers to share your product or service with friends via WhatsApp, SMS, Facebook, or Twitter
Click to follow on social: Effortlessly grow your social audience on Instagram, Twitter, Facebook, etc.
Collect feedback & reviews: Collect constructive product feedback as well as reviews that can be used in future marketing
What the new Paystack Checkout Form means for Developers
If you're a developer who has integrated Paystack previously (or if you've built a plugin for Paystack), there's nothing you need to do to prepare for the rollout of the new Paystack Checkout Form.
The only thing worth knowing is that if you implemented Paystack via Inline Embed, customers will see the old Checkout Form, instead of the new one.
The new Checkout Form was designed and developed to be backwards compatible, but we encourage you to test your integrations to ensure that everything looks and behaves as expected. If you have any questions, please swing by the Paystack Developer Slack community.
Try the new Paystack Checkout Form right now
The new checkout form is currently in beta while we test it for a few weeks. 
Want to see it in action? You can try it on the Paystack Demo: paystack.com/demo
If you see anything funky, please shoot us an email to let us know at checkoutform@paystack.com!
Join the Beta and get the new Checkout Form before everyone else
The new Paystack Checkout Form will be rolling out to all Paystack merchants in late July/early August. In the meantime, we’re running a Beta for a handful of Paystack businesses who’re interested in helping us take it through its paces.
Here’s what you need to be able to join the Beta:
You must have a live Paystack business
You must be willing to be super engaged with giving feedback (eg. by answering surveys about your experience, or doing 10 mins phone interviews)
If that sounds like you, please apply to join the Beta.
(Please note that the new payment channels will only appear in the latter parts of the Beta, not immediately.)
The world’s best checkout form, working hard for businesses in Africa
The new Paystack Checkout Form is a performant powerhouse, able to power payments for all scales of business, from a global airline to an Instagram clothing store.
Think of it as your business’ additional employee - a robust growth engine working hard to convert visitors into paying customers. Your customers will also enjoy a fast, intuitive, beautiful payment experience that elevates your brand, and gives them the confidence to enter their payment details.
We’ve set out to create the world’s best Checkout Form, and to put it to work in the service of African businesses. Over the next few weeks, we’ll be going under the hood and sharing more details about its design and development, so look out for that.
Questions or feedback?

New: Customer Insights and revamped Customer Directory on the Paystack Dashboard
Understand your customers’ purchase patterns with the brand new Paystack Customer Insights page and the revamped Customer Directory

The Improved Customer Directory
In Summary
More info?
The best-performing businesses on Paystack enjoy double-digit revenue growth rates, every single month. What differentiates them from everyone else? They’re deeply data driven. They look closely at their payments data to understand buying patterns, and these insights drive business decisions.
Previously, such insights were relatively hard to surface, so they were only easily available to large merchants with the time and resources to mine the data. Today, we’re excited to announce two big improvements to the Paystack Dashboard that make it a lot easier for ALL Paystack merchants to understand their customers’ purchase patterns.
Here’s what’s new:
We’ve launched a brand new Customer Insights page
We’ve made the Customer Directory a lot more powerful
The Brand New Customer Insights Page
The Customer Insights section is a customer analytics tool designed to give you a better understanding of who your customers are, and their buying patterns.
Here's a short video that walks you through all you need to know about Customer Insights on the Paystack Dashboard
Below, I’ll list out all the data that you now have access to on the Customer Insights page, and a few ideas for how you can use this information to grow your business:
Customer Growth
This section gives you a visual representation of the number of customers who have done business with you over a period of time. At a glance, you can tell how your customer growth changed over time. This section also allows you to see customer growth specifically for New or Returning customers.
As a business owner, this section may help you understand how well a promotional campaign performed.

Top Customers
This section shows you who your best customers are.
There’re two lists - Biggest Spenders (a ranked list of customers who spent the most amount of money within a time period), and Most Payments (a ranked list of customers who made the most number of payments within a time period). You can also quickly see how much of your revenue this customer accounts for, and whether they’re a brand new or a returning customer.
Information from this section can help you target loyalty schemes at the right customers - letting you reward your top customers, and incentivise other customers to spend more on your business.
Busiest day of the week
This section shows the relative amount of payments activity happening for each day of the week. This information can inform staffing decisions - for instance, if most payments are happening on Thursday, you might want to have more Customer Support people on standby on that day to deal with higher-than-average support requests.
        
Busiest time of day
This section shows you the relative amount of payments activity that happens during the course of an average day.
         
Share of revenue
Many businesses try not to rely on only a relatively few number of customers for a large share of their revenue. In a situation where 5 customers account for 95% of your revenue, for example, losing one customer could be fatal to your business.
This section lets you track what percentage of your revenue is due to your biggest customers, allowing you to strike a healthy share of revenue balance for your business
                            
NOTE: All the insights that you get from the Dashboard are shown for only a time frame of your choosing. From the section of the Customer Insights page annotated as '1' below, you may choose to display customer insights for any of the preset time frames listed in the dropdown, or for a custom time frame by clicking on Custom Period, annotated as '2' below

 			The date range filter on the Customer Insights page 		
To access Customer Insights, log into your Paystack Dashboard, and click onInsights in the menu column.
The Improved Customer Directory
 			A close-up on the new customer search filter on the Customer Directory page 		
The Customer Directory is where you see a list of all customers that have ever made payments to your business. 
Before now, you could only filter the list of customers by the date when they made their very first transaction. With the latest improvement to the Customer Directory, you can now search for customers using a number of useful search criteria listed below:
1. Type of transactions the customer(s) have had
Any transaction
At least one successful transaction
At least one failed transaction
At least one abandonned transaction
At least one reversed transaction
2. Date range
All time
Specific day
Today
Over a time range (say between February 1, 2017 - February 14, 2017)
3. Type of customers:
new
returning
Finally, you can now also Export the Customer lists generated from these filters.
Just as in the old Customer Directory, you can still click on each customer to find out more information about them such as a list of their transactions, email address, and their subscriptions.
To access the improved Customer Directory, log into your Paystack Dashboard, and click on Customerson the menu column.
In Summary
Paystack is more than payments gateway. In addition to one of the industry’s best-performing payments options, we build useful tools to help merchants better understand payments information, and make better business decisions.
We hope you find the new Customer analytics tools useful, and that they help you learn things you didn’t know that you didn’t know about your customers 😁Here’s to growth! 🥂

New: Improved User Roles and permissions management on the Paystack Dashboard
Invite more members of your team to your Paystack Dashboard, and choose exactly what they can see and do

In Summary
More info?
We’re excited to introduce improved User Roles and permissions management to the Paystack Dashboard! You now have more granular control over exactly what each member of your team can see and do on your Paystack Dashboard. 
Introducing the new Default User Roles
Previously, these were the User Roles on the Paystack Dashboard: 
Main Owner
Admin
Employee
Consultant
Following the revamp, those default roles have now been replaced with these:
Business Owner
Admin
Operations
Developer Support
Customer Support
These User Roles - and the default permissions they have access to - have been designed to fit the broad use cases we see. Here’s a breakdown of each user role:
Business Owner: There can be only one Business Owner at a time. This person has complete access to all parts of the Dashboard and can’t be removed by Admins.
Admin: This role grants users the permissions to manage everything on the Dashboard. You can add, manage, and remove team members, move money out, and manage all the settings on your business’ Paystack Dashboard.
Operations: This role grants users the permissions to manage everything on the Dashboard, with the exception of making transfers from your business’ Paystack balance. This role is ideal for a business manager who needs full visibility into your business, but should not have the ability to move funds out of the business.
Developer Support: This role grants users the permissions necessary for providing technical support. Users in this group can view and manage things like API Keys and webhooks, business settings, and more. However, they can’t access sensitive information such as your business’ performance, balance history, and other settings which allow them to move money out of your balance. Want to invite a software developer to help you integrate Paystack on your behalf? This is the role you’d likely want to assign to them.
Customer Support: This role grants users the permissions necessary to provide support to your business’ customers. It allows the users to view only your business’ transactions and customers. Say a customer calls to complain about a recent order. Team members with this role are empowered to quickly look up the transaction details and better support that customer.
How to manage User Roles
Here’s a quick tutorial that’ll show you how to invite new users and manage user roles and permissions on the Paystack Dashboard!
Here’s a simple breakdown of the steps needed to manage your team members’ User Roles:
Log into your Paystack Dashboard, and click on Settings
Select the Team tab, and then click on Change role next to the team member’s email, and annotated as '1' below
Select one of the default user roles, or a custom role that you created by clicking on the menu selector annotated as '2' below. This reveals all the default and custom user roles
Click on Save, and the team member’s updated user permissions would have been saved
About Custom User Roles
Custom user roles allow you to choose exactly what team members can see and do on the Paystack Dashboard. If the default user roles do not meet your needs, you can simply create a Custom Role that has the exact permissions you require.
Here’s a breakdown of how to create custom user roles on the Paystack Dashboard:
From the Team tab on the Settings page of the Paystack Dashboard, click on Manage Roles annotated as '3' below
Next, click on Create a custom role annotated as '4' below which reveals a custom role creation form
Fill in the Create Custom Role form, and then click on Create Role at the bottom of the form to create your custom role
How to find your updated permissions
Here’s a breakdown of how to find your updated user role and permission:
To view your updated user role and permissions, click on the menu icon at the top right of the Dashboard, and then click on Permissions annotated as '5' below
This reveals your user role, and a list of all the sections of the dashboard you can access, and those that you cannot
In Summary
The revamped User Roles and improved permissions management allows you to add more members of your team to the Paystack Dashboard while giving them access to only the information and data that they need to do their jobs.
At Paystack, we strongly believe that payments information can help everyone in a company do their jobs better. Whether your teammates come from Finance, Customer Support, Marketing, or Engineering, there’re trends and insights buried inside your payments data that they can leverage to boost sales, shrink churn, and help you operate at peak efficiency.
With improved permissions, you can now confidently invite more members of your team into your Paystack Dashboard and give them guided access to the information they need in a secure way.

Before now, when you shared a Payment Page on social media, the default image that would be displayed was the Paystack logo. Now, you can customize a Payment Page to display an image of your choice.
Let me show you what I mean. The is how a Paystack Payment Page looks like by default when it’s shared on social media.
 			A screenshot of a Payment Page with the default Paystack image as shared on Twitter 		
And this is what the same Payment Page looks like when a custom image is added! Adding an image makes your Payment Page look a lot better on social media, and will likely increase the number of people who’ll click on the link, and who’ll convert to become paying customers.
 			A screenshot of a Payment Page with a customised image 		
Here’s how to add a social image to your Payment Page:
Log in to your Paystack Dashboard and click on Payment Pages annotated as '5' below
Select your preferred Payment Page type, and then click on Upload Image annotated as '6' below to upload an image
NOTE: Take care to select an image that’s less than 1MB in size, and preferrably with dimensions of 1024 x 512 pixels
 			Uploading open graph images for Payment Pages 		
Click on Create to create your Payment Page with a customised image
4. New: Include a custom message in your customers’ email receipts
When customers make successful transactions, you’ve always been able to show them instant success messages on the screen and have Paystack send them automated email receipts. Now, that success message also shows up in the body of the email receipt.
Here’s how to go about it:
Check to see that under your Preferences menu on the Paystack Dashboard, the Email receipts to customers option, annotated as '7' below, is checked
On your Payment Page creation form, type in your preferred success message in the field annotated as '8' below
Fill in the remaining fields in the Payment Page’s creation form as required, and click on 'Create' to create your Payment Page and include a customized message in the email receipt.
5. New: Duplicate Payment Pages
With the new duplicate feature, you can now duplicate a live Payment Page and then modify it instead of creating a similar one from scratch.
Say you’re creating a Payment Page for an earring and you’d like to test two different Payment Pages with two different images so you can determine the version that enjoys the most engagement; you could simply create a Payment Page, duplicate it, and change just the image in the duplicate.
Here’s how to duplicate a Payment Page:
Select the Payment Page you want to duplicate from your list of existing Payment Pages
You can only duplicate a live Payment Page, so first, take the original Payment Page live. Next, click on Duplicate, annotated as '9' in the screenshot below:
Modify the image or some other property of the duplicated Payment Page, save, and publish!
In Summary
We’ve introduced these enhancements to Payment Pages so you can do even more with them. We’re excited to see you grow your business with Paystack Payment Pages!

Introducing Split Payments on Paystack Payment Pages

What is a subaccount?
Here’s how to set up Split Payments on Payment Pages
The 2 possible methods of splitting payments
A few ways you can use split payments on Payment Pages
In Summary
More info?
Payment Pages are the simplest way to accept online payments with Paystack. Merchants who don’t have their own website, for example, can quickly whip up a simple page through which customers can pay for goods and services.
We’re always looking for ways to improve the flexibility of Payment Pages while keeping them simple, and we’re excited to introduce a simple but powerful improvement - Split Payments on Payment Pages.
With Split Payments, when a payment is made via a Payment Page, merchants can now automatically split the money with another bank account (a subaccount).
What is a subaccount?
A Subaccount is a bank account different from the Paystack merchant’s primary bank account. When a payment is split, part of the money is deposited into the subaccount bank account. 
So say you wanted to send 50% of all payments collected via a Payment Page to your business partner’s bank account. You would simply create a subaccount for them, and then automatically split all payments received using the Split Payments feature.
Here’s a video tutorial that shows you in detail, how to create a Paystack subaccount:
Here’s how to set up Split Payments on Payment Pages
To get started, first, you create a Paystack subaccount by clicking on Subaccounts annotated as '1' below. You may also access that page by following this link directly
Next, create a Payment Page by clicking on Payment Pages from the menu panel. As you fill the Payment Pages creation form, select your preferred subaccount under the Split payment with a subaccount field annotated as '2' below
Finally, you create your Payment Page, share it with your customers and let Paystack handle the splits.
This in-depth video tutorial will walk you through how to set up split payments on a Paystack Payment Page. You’ll learn:
How to add a subaccount to your Payment Page
How to set up a predetermined sharing formula between the main and sub Paystack account
The 2 possible methods of splitting payments
You can split payments in 2 different ways:
Splitting using percentages: Using this method, you could split payments between the merchant bank account and the subaccount in percentage ratios that add up to 100%. It could be 80:20, 50:50, 35:65 or some other percentage split that adds up to 100%.
Splitting using fixed amounts: This method allows you to send a fixed amount from each payment received through a Payment Page to the merchant’s bank account, and then the remainder of the payments to the subaccount. To illustrate, if a Payment Page were set up to sell headphones that cost ₦5,000. You could use Split Payments to send ₦3,000 to the merchant’s bank account after every sale, while the remainder goes to the subaccount
A few ways you can use split payments on Payment Pages
Here’re some creative ways you could use split payments on Payment Pages
1. Affiliate programmes: If your business runs an affiliate programme where you pay referers a small percentage for directing buyers to your platform, then you can simply:
Create subaccounts for each of your affiliate partners
Create Payment Pages for each of them
Have them share links to the Payment Pages created for them with the people they refer 
Split the payments made through each page between you and the affiliate partners in agreed upon ratios
2. Corporate Charity Programs: If your business were associated with a charitable cause, you could use Split Payments to send a share of all payments received to the charity. For example, if you own a store that sells eyeglasses and you committed to donate 5% of all your sales to the community eye clinic, you could simply create a subaccount for the clinic, and for every eyeglass sale that you make, 5% of the payment will be automatically sent to the clinic - easy!
3. Creative agencies that manage social media influencers: Sometimes, social media influencers are hired to promote a brand. Agencies who work with these influencers can use the split payments feature to pay the influencers everytime a product they promote gets sold
In Summary
Split payments on Payment Pages makes it easy for businesses to accept payments from their customers, and easily share their revenue with other parties.

Introducing Bulk Transfers on the Paystack Dashboard
Previously, Paystack merchants could only send bulk transfers via the Paystack API. Now, you can send bulk transfers via the Paystack Dashboard too.

Some ways merchants use Bulk Transfers
Here’s how to send Bulk Transfers from the Paystack Dashboard
In Summary
More info?
The new Bulk Transfers feature allows you to transfer funds from your Paystack Balance to multiple bank accounts at the same time by uploading a spreadsheet containing the recipients’ details , direct from your Paystack Dashboard.
Previously, you could only make bulk transfers using the Paystack API, and the Dashboard only allowed you to send one transfer at a time. Now, you simply create a spreadsheet containing all the necessary recipient information, upload it, and leave Paystack to do the multiple transfers.
Some ways merchants use Bulk Transfers
Financial service apps that need to distribute money to multiple recipients at the same time can now do it via the Paystack Dashboard.
Businesses with multiple stores or suppliers can now also send money quickly.
We also see businesses use Bulk Transfers to pay staff salaries at the end of every month.
Here’s how to send Bulk Transfers from the Paystack Dashboard
Confirm that you listed a correct business phone number on your Paystack Dashboard. To check, simply go to the Settings page on the Paystack Dashboard, and then select the Business tab. Here’s a direct link to the Business tab. When you get to the page, check your listed number in the Business Phone field annotated as '1' in the screenshot below
Next, go to the Preferences tab on the Settings page to disable Transfers One Time Password (OTP) confirmation. This step is very important because it allows you to make multiple transfers without having to enter an OTP for every single transfer. An OTP is sent to your business phone number and you can enter it in the Enter Code field as shown in the screenshot below. Here’s a direct link to the Preferences tab.
Next, click on Transfers from the menu panel, and then on the New Transfer dropdown at the top right dropdown from where you can select the Bulk Upload option.
Click on the Choose File button to upload a spreadsheet containing all the recipients’ bank account details and the amounts to be transferred to them. IMPORTANT: the headers of the spreadsheet need to be in a specific format for the transfer to work. You may click on Sample CSV to see the acceptable spreadsheet formats that can be uploaded.
After you upload the spreadsheet, click on Start Bulk Transfer to initiate the transfer
Here’s a tutorial video that shows you in detail how to make Bulk Transfers:
In Summary
The Bulk Transfer feature is built for when you need to make numerous transfers to more than one bank account. No matter how large your recipient list is, Paystack’s Bulk Transfer feature is fast, easy to use, and doesn’t require a single line of code; all you do is upload, click, and transfer!

Introducing Paystack Starter Businesses
Unregistered businesses can now accept online payments with Paystack, without needing a Corporate Bank Account or company registration document
Emmanuel Quartey
Head of Growth, 					Paystack
On this page
One of the most popular feature requests we receive at Paystack is for unregistered businesses to be able to use Paystack, without needing to submit a Corporate Bank Account or company registration document. Well, we have some good news 😄
Introducing Paystack Starter Businesses
Unregistered businesses can now accept online payments with Paystack as Paystack Starter Businesses. Starter Businesses do not need to submit a corporate bank account or certificate of incorporation to use Paystack.
This merchant tier is intended for people who’re looking to validate their business ideas for a period of time with real customers.
Shareable Takeaway
Unregistered businesses can now accept online payments with Paystack without a corporate bank account or company registration document!
 					Share on WhatsApp 				 					Share on Facebook 				 					Share on Twitter 				
Starter Business Requirements
To become a Starter Business on Paystack, you need to submit only three things:
Bank Verification Number (BVN)
Your Bank Account Number (personal bank accounts are allowed)
Evidence of Identity - this could be:
the information page of your Passport OR
a Driver’s License
a National ID OR
a Nigerian Voter's Card
You no longer need a Company Registration or Corporate Bank Account.
The difference between Paystack Starter Businesses and Paystack Registered Businesses
Starter Businesses have access to almost the same suite of powerful payment tools used by companies such as Domino’s Pizza, Taxify, Opera, Axa Mansard, Ikeja Electric, and over 8,000 of some of the best businesses in Nigeria.
The main difference is that Starter Businesses have a 2 million Naira limit, after which they'll need to submit documentation to become Registered Businesses. 
Here’s a thorough breakdown of the difference.
Behind the scenes of Paystack Starter Businesses
WARNING: The following section is a reeeeally deep dive, telling the story of the thinking behind Paystack Starter Businesses.
Unless you’re the kind of person who enjoys hearing about the nitty-gritty blow by blow account of how startups make decisions, you’ll be bored out of your mind.
…still here? Okay, cool - let’s dive in 😄 
Before Paystack 'Starter Businesses,' there were 'Personal Accounts'
One of the most popular feature requests we receive at Paystack is for unregistered businesses to be able to use Paystack without needing a corporate bank account or company registration document.
We hear it so often that we actually came extremely close to launching this in Q4 2017, at the time called Personal Accounts.
 			Early discussions about Paystack Personal Accounts in September 2017 		
The benefits of launching Personal Accounts were obvious: many more people would be able to use Paystack. This would in turn grow our transaction volumes and take us closer to our internal milestone processing 10 billion Naira monthly.
As we neared the launch, however, we realized that there’re a number of not-so-obvious complications of Personal Accounts.
The mission of Paystack is to help businesses grow
At Paystack we believe strongly that our mission is to help businesses in Africa become massively profitable, envied, and loved.
Dramatic? Yeah, a lil bit 😄 
But we genuinely aspire to be a growth engine for businesses. The way we do that today is through a kickass payment gateway, but we have our eyes set on providing an entire suite of tools to help businesses succeed in a global arena.
Whether you’re an Instagram merchant or a large multinational, if you’re a business in Africa with dreams of growth, Paystack’s goal is to give you every unfair advantage you need to succeed.
For this reason, we realized that it wasn't enough to enable merchants get started - we also needed to provide a path towards helping motivated merchants to be able to formalize their businesses with as little friction as possible.
This is not out of any deep love for the process of registering companies, but because being a formally incorporated company is an important step towards becoming a globally-relevant business.
We started to think of Paystack Starter Businesses as the first step of a business' growth story. 
First, you put the idea into the world, you validate it over time, then you mature into a fully formalized business.
With this in mind, we reached out to partners like DIY Law, a legal startup, to help make the company formalization process as seamless as possible.
 			Scene from a recent community event at Paystack HQ 		
All business need a chance to walk before they can run
The truth is that not everyone can afford to (or should!) jump toward company incorporation from day one.
Imagine you’re in the early stages of your idea. You have a hunch that this idea could be big, but you need a way to validate it. There needs to be a way to quickly test the idea with real customers.
The more we spoke to prospective merchants about why they needed the unregistered business option, the more we realized that this was where many of them were: at the very early stages of an idea that could become so much more, if the idea was given a chance to prove itself.
These conversations helped us figure out which tools to make available to Starter Businesses. 
Instead of being overly restrictive in the tools Starter Businesses could have access to, we ultimately decided to make almost the entire Paystack suite available to Starter Businesses, giving them the same calibre of tools of much larger companies like Axa Mansard, Domino's Pizza, and Opera.
This way, Starter Business have every opportunity to succeed.
Shareable Takeaway
Paystack Starter Business have access to the same suite of high quality payment tools used by companies like Opera, Axa Mansard, and Domino's Pizza.
 					Share on WhatsApp 				 					Share on Facebook 				 					Share on Twitter 				
Maintaining the trust of the end customer
There was one last set of conversations that clarified in our minds what our strategy should be for unregistered businesses - conversations with the customers of our merchants.
We learned that for our merchants' customers, there’s an implicit promise of trust in the Paystack brand.
Customers trust that when they’re paying a Paystack merchant, that merchant has been vetted. When we give a merchant the tools to accept payments from real customers, we signal to the customer that this merchant is honest and trust-worthy. 
From the customers’ perspective, if anything goes wrong, we’re as much to blame for giving the merchants those tools in the first place.
In a low trust environment like Nigeria, where many people are making payment online for the first time, it’s absolutely critical that when people encounter online payments, their experience is as pleasant - and as fraud-free - as possible. 
This is a responsibility we take extremely seriously.
We realized that we needed to balance the strong desire to open Paystack up to unregistered business against the equally strong obligation to protect the interests of customers.
We significantly beefed up our automated anti-fraud systems, applied a maximum collections cap to Starter Businesses, and engaged partners like Truecaller, to make possible new tools to verify the identity of Paystack Starter Businesses.
 			Scene from a recent community event at Paystack HQ 		
Bringing it all together
So these were some of the thoughts that swirled in our heads as we worked to articulate our approach to making Paystack available to unregistered businesses. 
Our solution - Paystack Starter Businesses - aims to achieve three things:
1. Make it easy for people with ideas to validate them with real customers: With only a BVN, a personal bank account, and a means of identification (passport, driver's license, or National ID), anyone with an idea can start validating their ideas quickly.
2. Protect the end-customer from fraudsters: We beefed up our fraud rules, limited the total amount that Starter Businesses can collect, and even partnered with our friends at Truecaller to verify the identities of Starter Business merchant.
3. Help make the incorporation process as easy as possible: We’ve partnered with our friends at DIY Law to provide subsidized incorporation services, so that Paystack merchants who have validated their ideas and are ready to incorporate can do so as painlessly as possible. We’re also working with our banking partners to make the corporate bank account creation process also seamless. More news on this soon!
The Paystack Starter Business tier is for growth-minded businesses in the validation stage
We recognize that the way we’re thinking about Starter Businesses might not be the right fit for everyone who needs a way to accept payment online. 
If you never intend to eventually register your business at all, for example, you’ll be frustrated by the 2 million Naira cap.
To be very honest, we’re really nervous about this. This is one of the most opinionated product decisions we’ve ever made, and we did it knowing that the consequence of this decision is that some merchants will opt for alternate payment gateways. And we accept this.
With Paystack Starter Businesses, we're able to support merchants from every stage of their growth story - from when an entrepreneur first has an idea, through those exciting early signs of success, and all the way to when they formalize the business.

Paystack has maintained a merchant-first focus since the very beginning of the company. We believe strongly that this laser focus on growth-minded businesses allows us to deliver the best quality products and services to the merchants who share the same dream we do: a tribe of thousands of the best businesses on the continent, united by the goal of becoming profitable, envied, and loved.

Paystack partners with Truecaller to enable more African businesses accept payments online
The partnership enables phone number verification of Paystack Starter Businesses, as well as the launch of a powerful new phone number verification tool for developers
Emmanuel Quartey
Head of Growth, 					Paystack
On this page
We’re excited to announce a partnership with Truecaller (one of the world’s largest mobile identity platforms) to allow more merchants across Africa accept payments online in a frictionless and secure manner by leveraging Truecaller’s mobile identity product, Truecaller SDK.
Paystack is leveraging the Truecaller SDK in two important ways:
to strengthen the identity verification of Paystack merchants
to provide a new phone number verification tool to Paystack merchants who want to confirm the mobile-based identity of their own customers
1. Verifying the identity of Paystack Starter Businesses
Paystack has just announced the launch of Paystack Starter Businesses, a merchant tier that allows businesses to start using Paystack without the need for a corporate bank account or company registration certificate.
Using the Truecaller SDK, Paystack is able to verify the identity of Starter Business merchants by verifying their phone number. This is in addition to proprietary risk checks that Paystack runs.
Starter Business merchants usually have a collections limit of 2 million Naira applied to their businesses, but merchants who opt into phone number verification via Truecaller enjoy an increase of the limit to 3 million Naira.
Learn more about Paystack Starter Businesses
Shareable Takeaway
Paystack has partnered with Truecaller to verify the identity of Paystack merchants, and make it possible for more merchants to accept payments online
 					Share on WhatsApp 				 					Share on Facebook 				 					Share on Twitter 				
How it works
Let’s use the Paystack Starter Business merchant verification as an example of the Truecaller SDK in action.
A prospective Starter Business merchant is attempting to activate his business on Paystack. He sees that he can verify his phone number with Truecaller.
He triggers the verification and sees an instruction to check his phone
When he checks his phone, he sees a prompt from Paystack to verify his Truecaller ID.
Clicking on the green button completes the verification.
2. Providing tools to Paystack merchants to do phone number verification of their customers
Paystack has always provided tools that allow developers and merchants to verify the identity of customers. Those verification options include:
BVN Verification: the ability to verify the Bank Verification Number (BVN) of customers (learn more)
Bank Account Verification: the ability to verify bank account details (learn more)

Resolve Card BIN: the ability to verify card details (learn more)
Paystack merchants such as Branch, Aella Credit, and Piggybank currently leverage these tools to power their business.
Thanks to the partnership with Truecaller, Paystack is now able to offer a fourth, brand new verification option - phone number verification - using the Truecaller SDK, that works for customers all over the world!
Merchants who integrate phone number verification are able to verify that their customers are who they say they are by confirming the following details:
phone number
customer name
customer email address
social media handles
customer company/organization
See Developer Documentation for Truecaller-powered phone number verification
A typical use case
Say you're a Paystack merchant who has a lending app, and you'd like to verify the identity of the people to whom you're giving loans. With phone number verification powered by the Truecaller SDK, you can give your customers the option to confirm that they are who they say they are by submitting their phone number.
When the customer initiates the phone number verification, they receive a prompt on their Truecaller app, asking if they accept the request to verify via Truecaller. Once the customer taps 'Accept,' the requisite information is passed on the merchant, who is then able to confirm the customer's identify against other submitted information.
Shareable Takeaway
Paystack has partnered with Truecaller to provide a tool that lets Paystack merchants verify the identity of their customers using only a phone number
 					Share on WhatsApp 				 					Share on Facebook 				 					Share on Twitter 				
Customer Data Privacy and Security
Both Paystack and Truecaller are obsessive about protecting the privacy and security of our users. The Truecaller SDK is a consent based service (just like Truecaller), which means that before any Truecaller user info is shared with a merchant, the Truecaller user must:
explicitly and proactively request for a phone number verification
receive a prompt via their Truecaller app asking if they agree to verify via Truecaller
explicitly click Accept on the prompt
In case the user changes their mind and no longer wants to verify, they can immediately reject the prompt.
Powering a vibrant online payment ecosystem
In our announcement about Paystack Starter Business, we mentioned that the mission of Paystack is to help businesses in Africa be profitable, envied, and loved. 
Today, the way we do this is through a kickass payment gateway, but we have our eyes set on an entire suite of tools to help our merchants grow. 
Those tools include verification APIs that allow our Paystack merchants verify the identity of their customers. In low-trust environments like Nigeria, such tools play an important role in powering a vibrant online payment ecosystem.
Over 50 million Africans use Truecaller. As Paystack gears up for a wave of expansion across the continent, we’re thrilled to have a partner like Truecaller enabling tools that increase trust, and helping support our vision of frictionless payments across Africa, powered by Paystack!",blog

Paystack partners with DIY Law to make company incorporation fast, easy, and affordable
The company incorporation process in Nigeria can be confusing and frustrating. DIY Law makes it simple for Paystack merchants.
Emmanuel Quartey
Head of Growth, 					Paystack
On this page
We recently announced Paystack Starter Businesses, a merchant tier for businesses who'd like to validate their ideas with real customers, without needing a corporate bank account or company registration.
While Paystack Starter Businesses enjoy almost all the same benefits as Registered Businesses, they don’t have access to the Paystack Transfers feature. Starter Businesses also have a 2 million Naira collections limit.
To remove these limits, Starter Business merchants will need to submit additional documents, including company registration documentation, and this is where DIY Law comes in.
Thanks to a partnership between Paystack and legal startup DIY Law, Paystack merchants will enjoy a discount towards the cost of completing their company registration process with DIY Law.
Shareable Takeaway
Paystack has partnered with DIY Law to make company incorporation for Paystack merchants fast, easy, and affordable.
 					Share on WhatsApp 				 					Share on Facebook 				 					Share on Twitter 				
DIY Law provides a transparent, simple, and affordable avenue for merchants who want to incorporate, but lack the time and knowhow to navigate the process by themselves. In addition to company incorporation, DIY Law is able to help with a whole range of legal services, such as Non Disclosure Agreements, TIN/VAT Registration, Registered Entity Search, and much more.
(Also, fun fact: DIY Law was one of the first businesses on Paystack when we launched 2 years ago! :D)
How to get access to the DIY Law perk
At the top right of the Dashboard, Starter Businesses will see the following dropdown.
Clicking 'Need help incorporating your business?' pulls up a modal where you'll be able to see the discount codes.
Our partnership with DIY Law is the first of a series of efforts to make the incorporation process as painless as possible for growth-minded businesses. Stay tuned for more!",blog

Introducing Paystack Automated Chargebacks
We’re excited to introduce a new and improved chargebacks process for Paystack merchants, launching on January 29th
Abdulrahman Jogbojogbo
Product Marketer, 					Paystack
On this page
Say hello to better chargeback management
A chargeback claim is a refund request that your customer makes at their bank when they believe that they haven’t received value for their money.
Merchants are required by the bank to respond to chargeback communications within 24 hours. If the merchant fails to respond in time, the claim is automatically approved, and the merchant is debited. (Note: this is the standard chargeback process for all payment gateways)
Before now, such claims were mostly hashed out via email and phone calls, which could be slow and inefficient.
From January 29th, when one of your customers goes to their bank to log a dispute against you, the claim will automatically show up on your Paystack Dashboard, and you’ll be able to accept or dispute the chargeback, right from your Dashboard!
How chargebacks are handled now
When a chargeback is issued against a Paystack merchant, the entire process of resolution (including sending proof of purchase) happens via numerous emails amongst multiple parties.
Merchants are unable to see a neat overview of all pending chargeback claims, and there’re rare occasions where duplicate chargeback claims are logged against the same transaction (the multiple email chains make it difficult to realize when this has happened).
It’s a cumbersome, inefficient process for all involved.
A look at the new chargeback system
The new system was designed to allow Paystack merchants have better control and visibility into chargeback claims made against you by your customers.
It starts with a brand new platform through which the bank logs the claim. This centralized platform makes it impossible for duplicate chargebacks to be claimed against the same transaction.
Once a claim is logged, Paystack immediately triggers a chargeback alert email to you to request your review. You’ll be able to log into the Paystack Dashboard to either accept the claim, or dispute it with evidence.
Remember how banks require merchants to respond within 24 hours, else the claim is automatically applied and you’re debited? If you’re nearing the deadline without responding, you’ll receive 2 helpful reminders to respond to the claim before the deadline.
Right from the email, you’ll be able to click on a link that takes you directly to the Paystack Dashboard.
You’ll see a conspicuous banner at the top of your dashboard that’s designed to alert you of pending transaction disputes. Simply click on the banner to start resolving the transaction disputes.
 			A screenshot of a sample chargeback-alert email 		
 			A screenshot showing the transaction-dispute alert banner on your Paystack Dashboard 		
On the page of the disputed transaction, you’ll be able to accept a claim, or reject it by uploading proof of delivery of service, such as a receipt of the transaction. The bank reviews the evidence you’ve submitted, and they can then take action based on the nature of your response.
 			A screenshot showing a disputed transaction 		
That’s it! You’ll now be able to manage all your pending chargeback claims right from your Dashboard, which makes it easier to protect your business from undue losses.
🚨 Important: Update your Chargeback Email address today
The new chargeback system goes live on the 29th of January. Paystack sends chargeback notifications to the Chargeback Email Address we have on file for your business. Please login to Paystack to update your Chargeback Email address as soon as possible.
These are very important alerts, so ensure that the email is monitored by a decision-maker at your organisation who is empowered to either accept or dispute the chargeback.
FAQ
When does the new Paystack Automated Chargeback system go live?
The new chargeback process will go live on January 29th, 2018. Starting from the the 29th, you’ll receive automated alerts when chargebacks claims are logged against your business. The email alerts will go to the Chargeback Email Address associated with your business on Paystack (this is why you should update your Chargeback Email address as soon as possible).
What happens if I don’t respond to the chargeback in 24 hours?
If after 24 hours, you don’t respond to chargeback queries, the banks assume that you didn’t offer value to the customer, your account is debited, and the customer is refunded. (Note: the regulations guiding chargebacks are in place to protect the customer, hence the lean-in that favours them)
Can I upload documents that show proof of service delivery?
Yes, you can. You can upload receipts, screenshots of transactions, and other documents that support your own claims.

Introducing Paystack Go!
Your most important business metrics, in the palm of your hand
Abdulrahman Jogbojogbo
Product Marketer, 					Paystack
On this page
The typical Paystack merchant is on the go: a meeting here, a negotiation there, maybe a quick detour for lunch. For merchants on the move, the Paystack Dashboard offers a much-needed bird’s-eye view of everything that’s going on with their business.
With this in mind, we set out to create a dashboard experience optimised for business owners on the go, and rather than simply squeezing the existing Paystack Dashboard onto a phone screen, we knew we needed to rethink the entire approach to providing business insights on mobile.
So we asked ourselves, what would the ideal dashboard experience be for busy business owners on the move?
It would require no more than a tap to access.
You would see your most important business metrics at a glance.
It would work in environments with poor cell reception.
It would even give you tools to close new deals.
We brought those ideas together into Paystack Go! — a mobile experience that helps Paystack merchants track their business’ performance on the move.
                        

What can you do with Paystack Go?
Think of Paystack Go as a fun, friendly helper that brings all of the superpowers of Paystack right into the palm of your hand.
 			Shots of different screens on Paystack Go! 		

Paystack Go works offline
We built Paystack Go knowing that a lot of our users experience poor network connectivity as they move around African cities. Paystack Go sits quietly in the background, collecting important data about your business when the network is good, and serves the most important info to you whenever you’re ready to take a glance. No internet? No problem — we’ve got you covered!
Track your business performance
See your daily, weekly, and monthly transaction revenues, number of payments, available balance, and transaction success rates, all in one glance.
Look up transaction details
See all the details of every payment, including amount paid, customer details, card info, and much more.
Send invoices
Sending invoices to your clients is now as easy as sending a text message. You can now quickly request for payment from your customers, and they’ll be able to pay you quickly and securely online. You’ll also be able to track who has paid, when they paid, and how much they paid.
Get push notifications on your mobile device when customers perform specific actions.
Revenue Targets (coming soon)
Set revenue milestones for your business, and get notifications when you fulfill them. You’ll also be able to keep track of how close you and your team are to meeting your revenue targets.

Common questions about Paystack Go
Is Paystack Go an Android or iOS mobile app?
Nope! Paystack Go is not a mobile app, so you won’t need to download it from the Google Play or iOS App Store. It’s what is known as a Progressive Web App (PWA), which is just a fancy way of saying that it’s a simple website which behaves as if it were a mobile app. This means that you get all the benefits of a mobile app experience (notifications, save to home screen, etc) and none of the annoying stuff such as updating the app every other day, and taking up space on your phone.
Who can use Paystack Go?
Paystack Go! is for merchants who have a live business on Paystack. If you’re not yet a Paystack merchant, create a free account right now to get started.
Does it cost extra to use Paystack Go?
Nope, Paystack Go! is 100% free! As long as you have a live business on Paystack, you can use Paystack Go at no additional cost.

2017 Year in Review — Paystack
As the Paystack team looks forward to 2018, here’s a look back at both the highs and lows of 2017!
Emmanuel Quartey
Head of Growth, 					Paystack
On this page
What went well in 2017
2017 was Paystack’s second full year of existence, and the year when many long months of hardwork started to snowball into big wins.
GROWTH & SCALE
We began the year with about 1,400 merchants and closed with over 7,700 live merchants accepting payments with Paystack
This time last year, we were doing ~200 million Naira (~$550,000) in monthly transaction value. In July 2017, we announced a milestone that meant a lot to us — doing our first 1 billion Naira (~$3 million) in monthly transaction value.
Four months later, we doubled that to hit ~2 billion Naira in monthly transaction value.
We’re closing 2017 with ~2.7 billion Naira (~$7.5 million) in monthly transaction value (these numbers are strictly the amount of money that customers paid to merchants — it does not include amounts processed as a result of transfers).
Another way to look at growth: this time last year, Paystack was doing between 2 million to 2.6 million API calls per month. Today, it’s between 35 million to 44 million API calls per month.
PRODUCT UPDATES
We improved the product in numerous important ways. Here’re some of the important ones:
We launched Paystack Transfers, a feature that allows Paystack merchants to store their revenue inside Paystack as a balance, and then use that store of value to transfer money to any Nigerian bank account.
We launched Paystack Invoices (previously called Payment Requests), which allows merchants to request payments from specific customers.
We launched Pay with Bank, which allows customers to pay Paystack merchants directly from their bank account.
We refreshed the Paystack Dashboard with detailed Success Rate and Error Rate data.
We also turned our internal tool — Watchtower — into a second product for our banking partners.
TEAM & COMMUNITY
In 2017 we invested significantly in the team, growing from 10 people at the beginning of the year, to 25 people at the close of the year.


To house the larger team, we moved into a new office. The Techpoint team were kind enough to do a photo and video tour of the space.
We were lucky to be one of 6 African startups invited to join the Google Launchpad Accelerator! Launchpad is a six-month acceleration program for promising startups from emerging markets.
The program began with a two-week, all-expense-paid program in the Launchpad space in San Francisco, followed by many months of individual mentoring.
We organized our first community event, the Y Combinator Lagos Meetup, where anyone considering applying to YC was able to come get application advice from 9 Nigerian and Ghanaian YC alumni companies. Check out the entire photo album here.
In the lead-up to the event, Shola (our CEO), shared Paystack’s entire Y Combinator application, complete with commentary and backstory.
Over 250 friends, both old and new, joined us for the event, including 3 tech startups from Ghana.
We also hosted a breakfast event with the Women of Paystack, where 50 women curious about career opportunities in tech learned about the different pathways they could take into the industry. See the photo album from the event here.
Finally, we celebrated the first wedding of a teammate!




FIRST TEAMMATE WEDDING! The entire Paystack family wishes a lifetime of happiness to our Head of HR, the radiant Mrs. Abiola Mabawonku! #OPEBI2017 ✨ 							
What we wrestled with in 2017
2017 wasn’t all smooth sailing, and almost all of the challenges we wrestled with were related in one way or another to growing so fast, so quickly. As the the product grew in size and complexity, it became harder to keep up with bugs and feature requests.
At the lowest point, we were an average of two days behind our support inbox. This kicked off an intense investment in our Customer Success team. We grew our support team from 2 person to 7 people, invested in tools like our new self-serve Help Desk, and streamlined internal processes to be able to provide support faster (and ensure that some things never emerged as issues in the first place). These efforts paid off in a big way — we’ve reduced first response time to only a few hours — but there’s a lot more to do to give our merchants the best possible support experience possible.
We also had to learn how to hire. In the first few years of the company, we could rely on close friends to hop on board, but the downside to that was that we entered 2017 with too little structure around our hiring process.
Exactly what questions should you ask during the in-person interview? Should we do phone screenings? What does a fair compensation and benefits package look like? Who should lead which parts of our new onboarding process?
These were all questions we wrestled with, and while we’re still far from perfect, we’re going into 2018 a lot better equipped to find incredible people, and equip them with everything they need to succeed at Paystack.
Reflections from the team
Paystack is nothing without our team. Some of them have penned their personal end of year reviews, so here’s what 2017 looked like in their own words (will update as more people publish theirs).

🌻 Flourish — Paystack 2017 End of Year Playlist
We use the messaging tool Slack at Paystack for internal communications. There’s a music channel where members of the team share what they’re jamming to —the channel is almost like a time capsule of how people were feeling all throughout the year.
Flourish - Paystack 2017 End of Year Playlist
Thank you
Paystack shouldn’t exist.
Two geeks with no institutional backing and no formal financial training had no business sticking their nose into fintech. And yet here we are, two years later, held up quite literally by thousands of hands.
As we venture into Paystack’s third year, we want to say thank you. Thank you to investors who took a chance on us when they had little reason to. Thank you to Paystackers who chose Paystack when they could be working anywhere. Thank you to numerous partners and advocates who’ve held doors open for us with the right introduction at the right time. Thank you to every feature request and every reminder to do better.
And most of all, thank you to the over 7,700 Nigerian merchants who’ve entrusted us with your business. You give us purpose, and in 2018, we aim to go above and beyond to reward you everyday for your confidence in us.
Thank you.
Onwards.

The 3 Ghanaian startups joining us at the Y Combinator Lagos Meetup
YC alums Tress, OMG Digital, and Paystack joined forces to make it possible for 3 Ghanaian startups to attend the Y Combinator Lagos Meetup.
Abdulrahman Jogbojogbo
Product Marketer, 					Paystack
On this page
A few weeks ago, YC alums Tress, OMG Digital, and Paystack joined forces to make it possible for 3 Ghanaian startups to attend the Y Combinator Lagos Meetup.
We enjoyed reviewing over 80 high quality Ghanaian startups for the opportunity, and we’re excited to announce the three teams who’ll be getting free flights and hotel rooms for the weekend to join us for the event!
1. Anitrack
 			Anitrack team 		
Anitrack is a livestock management system that identifies livestock and tracks their health using RFID and other wearable technology.
What’s the opportunity the Anitrack team is going after?
'Livestock farming feeds the majority of African, and employs over 80% of the agriculture population in Africa according to the World Bank. Despite this, there’re surprisingly few efforts geared towards ensuring that livestock farming is as efficient and as profitable as possible. Farmers end up losing their animals due to cattle theft as well as diseases.
Anitrack seeks to help mitigate these losses through technology that helps farmers better track the movement of their livestock, and also passively monitor them for health issues. This was increase yield, create wealth, and put Africa on the map for beef exports and cattle farming.'
What successes are you especially proud of?
'Anitrack has signed on Farmable.me to provide the 7,500 livestock on their platform with Anitrack monitoring devices. We’ve done a trial run of about 100 cattle, and are looking forward to tagging the remaining cattle.'
What kinds of people are you hoping to meet at the YC Lagos Meetup? What’re you hoping to take away from the experience?
'We hope to meet domain experts in agritech, Internet of Things, and making a product for a market that’s not necessarily tech savvy. We also hope to learn more about how to put together a winning YC pitch.'
2. Dext Technology
 			Dext Techonlogy founders 		
Dext Technology has created a science laboratory that is small enough to fit in the bag of a student, and affordable enough — 50 cedis (~$11) — to make it accessible. They aim to give every student in African a personal science lab and introduce them to hands-on science.
Their Science Set help primary level students perform basic science experiments involving electromagnetism, electrical circuits, and more. The set contains 45+ components and can be used to perform over 26 experiments found within the curriculum of schools in Ghana and Africa.
What’s the opportunity the Dext Technology team is going after?
'The World Bank estimates that there are over 150 million primary and secondary school students in Africa. Our product, the science set is design to meet both the academic and recreational demands of these students. We envision the science set becoming ubiquitous learning tool in the 10 billion dollar educational material market.'
What successes are you especially proud of?
'The success we’re most proud of is the over 1,500 students and teachers across Ghana who are experiencing science differently because of our Science Set. Additionally, we were excited to win the American Society of Mechanical Engineers 2017 Innovation Show, and to received an Engineering Excellence award from the Ghana Institute of Engineers.'
What kinds of people are you hoping to meet at the YC Lagos Meetup? What’re you hoping to take away from the experience?
'We hope to meet fellow startup founders and hear their stories; failures and successes. We hope to take away valuable insights into issues like funding and customer acquisition and how to generally succeed in as a startup.'
3. Joluud
 			Joluud team 		
Facility managers have a hard time tracking maintenance operations and cost.
Joluud is building a platform for managers of complex facilities to track and see where they spend their time, effort, and money.
What’s the opportunity the Joluud team is going after?
'Every day, more serviced apartments, planned communities, hotels, office spaces, hostels, spring up across Africa. Facility managers of these spaces currently universally use Excel sheets and paper to manage the ever growing maintenance and upgrade requests of their clients. We believe that that there’s a big opportunity to provide a platform that helps both facility managers and their clients have visibility into the needs of the physical infrastructures they manage and occupy.'
What successes are you especially proud of?
'We’re proud of the fact that we developed a working prototype and signed up five companies in less than a month with less than $500 dollars.'
What kinds of people are you hoping to meet at the YC Lagos Meetup? What’re you hoping to take away from the experience?
'We hope to meet people who have experience building B2B (business-to-business) software companies here in Africa, and have found a way to make them viable. We’d also like to learn how to craft a great YC application.'

Paystack and LifeBank launch crowdfunding campaign for overlooked Makurdi flood victims
Following the flood in Makurdi, Paystack and Lifebank raised funds for some of the victims
 					Photo from a flooded community, from Guardian Nigeria

On this page
In late August 2017, torrential rainfall submerged over 3,000 homes in 24 communities in Nigeria’s Benue State. The disaster has displaced over 110,000 people.
As with all natural disasters, the outpouring of support was swift in the few days after the flooding occurred, but as often happens, once the cameras moved away, so did public attention on the crisis.
This is a huge issue, because post-emergency experts say that it’s actually during the post-flood period when victims are most vulnerable to disease, malnutrition, and death, but it’s at exactly this time when support dries up.
Already, Makurdi has began to slip from our television screens and radio announcements.
Paystack x LifeBank
Paystack has partnered with LifeBank to launch a crowdfunding campaign to fund the creation and distribution of life-saving Care Boxes full of critical food and health essentials.
Each Care Box contains over 30 critical food and health essentials, including soaps, Dettol, sanitary pads, blankets, Pampers, mosquito nets, plasters, cough syrup, skin rash cream, and much more.
LifeBank’s Care Boxes will act as a stabilizing force for many hundreds of thousands of people still reeling from the trauma of the floods.
100% of your donation goes to the campaign
Paystack is covering all transaction costs for donations made on this page, which means that 100% of your donation will go directly towards the creation and distribution of Care Boxes.
Additionally, Paystack is contributing a company donation of 300,000 Naira towards the campaign.

Paystack’s Y Combinator Application
Paystack's entire Y Combinator Application complete with commentary and backstory
Shola Akinlade
CEO, 					Paystack
On this page
Hello, my name is Shola Akinlade, and I'm CEO of Paystack, a payments company that helps African merchants accept payments from anyone, anywhere in the world.
On 11th November 2015, Paystack became the first Nigerian company to be invited to join the Y Combinator Accelerator program. The experience quite literally changed my life, opening doors and making it possible for my tiny team and I to have a shot at making payments in Nigeria a little better.
The deadline for applications to the Y Combinator Winter 2019 funding cycle is 8 pm PT on October 2. I'd like to encourage you and your team to consider applying to YC.
When I try to get some of my friends to apply, many respond with something along the lines of 'We have so little.' Too many promising African teams fail to shoot their shot because they see where famous YC companies like Dropbox and Airbnb are now, and they forget that those companies also started from 0.
I'm sharing Paystack's YC application to show just how green you can be and still make it.
To be honest, it's hard not to cringe while reading over our application, almost exactly two years after I pressed 'Submit,' but with luck, you'll come away realizing that if this dreamer can do it, you and your awesome team have a shot :)
You'll find commentary interspersed throughout the application, providing context and background, and if you have any follow-up questions, you can find me on Twitter at @shollsman.
Apply to Y Combinator here.

https://www.paystack.co/
We launched with paystack.co, and it was about a year later that I was able to buy the .com domain from the previous owner. 
You know the freaky thing? The domain used to belong to a different Y Combinator company called PayStack, from the Summer 2011 YC batch! Many thanks to former PayStack CEO Sam Vafee for agreeing to sell us the domain! 🙌🏿
If you have an online demo, what’s the url?
(Please don’t password protect it; just use an obscure url.)
http://www.gingerbox.com.ng, www.jekalo.com, www.diylaw.ng
Gingerbox, Jekalo, and DIYLaw were some of our earliest customers. The way DIYLaw came on board was that I went to them to register the company, and they mentioned that they actually needed something like Paystack. That's how Paystack grew in the early days - purely by word of mouth.
Describe your company in 50 characters or less.
APIs and tools to enable merchants accept payments in African Markets
What is your company going to make?
Software and services needed for merchants in Africa to accept online payments from local and international customers. We provide a full stack APIs and we’ll securely collect, encrypt, transmit and store customer card information in a highly protected vault and offer continuous anti-fraud and charge back protection services.
To make these happen we’ve partnered with Access Bank (the third Largest Bank in Nigeria) and we’ve built a PCI Compliant payments infrastructure and APIs.
It's interesting to see how consistent our vision has remained. The only difference is that Paystack now works just as well for non-technical business owners as it does for developers. We power all scales of businesses, including some of Nigeria's best known brands such as Domino's Pizza, Taxify, Abia State University, Iroko TV, God is Good Motors (GIGM), Hotels.ng, and BusinessDay.
Additionally, our active banking relationships now include Zenith Bank, GT Bank, FCMB, Wema Bank / ALAT, Fidelity Bank, Diamond Bank, UBA, First Bank, and Heritage Bank.

Please tell us about an interesting project, preferably outside of class or work, that two or more of you created together. Include urls if possible.
N/A
How long have the founders known one another and how did you meet? Have any of the founders not met in person?
N/A
PROGRESS
How far along are you?
Private Beta. We are piloting with a dozen merchants and we have hundreds of merchants on our waiting list.
If you’ve already started working on it, how long have you been working and how many lines of code (if applicable) have you written?
Since Nov, 2014
Which of the following best describes your progress?
Private Beta
How many users do you have?
12 Pilot merchants and up to 400 on the waiting list
Do you have revenue?
Yes
How much revenue?
$1,300
Yup, this was literally everything we had made when we applied! Note that $1,000 of this came from a single transaction 😀 
I like to point this out when speaking to founders who have overblown assumptions about how much traction they need to have before applying to YC.
What is your monthly growth rate?
(in users or revenue or both)
We are currently growing our waiting list at 10x, and transaction volume at 15x.
If you’ve applied PREVIOUSLY with the same idea, how much progress have you made since the last time you applied? Anything change?
By the last application, it was just a prototype, now we’re already running live transactions and we’ve released additional libraries.
If you have already participated or committed to participate in an incubator, 'accelerator' or 'pre-accelerator' program, please tell us about it.
N/a
IDEA
Why did you pick this idea to work on? Do you have domain expertise in this area? How do you know people need what you’re making?
When i founded my first startup in 2010, we needed a way to accept payments online, there was no solution locally, we had to work around using Avangate BV and creating accounts in the UK. 5 years later, there’s still no easy way.
I spent the entire 2014 implementing payments and disbursement solutions for Banks and i realized that most of the infrastructure needed to build a full stack payments API already existed, and it just needed someone to do the hardwork of putting it all together and doing all that is necessary. I finished the engagement in Nov. 2014 and immediately created Paystack.
The demand for Paystack is amazing, we haven’t done any PR or Marketing and we’re growing our waiting list at 10x monthly, just from word of mouth. I’ve personally spoken to over 150 merchants and everyone is excited and waiting. Our pilot merchants need it so much that they started using it without a settlement system, so they did not mind leaving their money with us for over 6 weeks.
What’s new about what you’re making? What substitutes do people resort to because it doesn’t exist yet (or they don’t know about it)?
What’s new? In Nigeria.. there’s still no way to accept recurring payments or one click payments. The incumbents are big co’s owned by banks and are not interested in innovating.
Substitutes, creating US or UK companies so they can use UK or US payment processors and then find ways to send the money back.
In hindsight, the quip about big companies not being 'interested in innovating,' was a little harsh. Two years later, I have a ton of respect and admiration for the impossible problems that the large payments companies had to solve to make it possible for Paystack to exist today. In too many ways to list, the current generation of fintech companies stand on the shoulders of giants.
Who are your competitors, and who might become competitors? Who do you fear most?
We have 3 types of competitors: (1) Local Financial Institutions (2) Global Payment cos and (3) Local non-Financial Institutions
Local FI’s are not able to progress because they mostly buy white label solutions. No incremental progress or problem-solving.
Global companies like Stripe and Braintree are competitors but it will be difficult for them to meet the needs of the African Merchants. It’s easy for them to offer Bitcoin or Apple Pay integration but what about Verve Cards (a pan African card scheme), or Mobile Money or other local card schemes?
Local Non FI’s are the real competition, but we believe that as long as we focus on solving the merchant’s needs we will continue to grow our business.
What do you understand about your business that other companies in it just don’t get?
Well, we’re firstly developers, then business owners, and merchants so we can feel the pain from a developer and merchant perspective. every other person right now seems to be more interested in their vested interests.
To this day I'm fiercely proud of the fact that Paystack continues to be an intensely  product-led company. Everyone on the team has some sort of side hustle (which means we feel our customers' pain firsthand) and we're all makers (which means we don't rest until stuff just works).
By the way, if you're looking to purchase fine Italian wines, small chops for your event, tailoring services, or luxury packaging, there're multiple members of the Paystack team who can hook you up for a good price.
I'm not joking even one bit. Seriously, holla: <a href='mailto:hello@paystack.com'>hello@paystack.com</a>
How do or will you make money? How much could you make?
(We realize you can’t know precisely, but give your best estimate.)
Transaction fees. 1.9% + 50cents
These days, most payment gateways in Nigeria charge roughly the same rate of 1.5%
How will you get users? If your idea is the type that faces a chicken-and-egg problem in the sense that it won’t be attractive to users till it has a lot of users (e.g. a marketplace, a dating site, an ad network), how will you overcome that?
We’re already getting users by word of mouth. We’re active in the local developer community, we’ll reach out to merchants directly, and we’ll signup merchants via integration with existing services (Shopify, eventbrite, woocommerce)   Our banking partner has also asked that we onboard thousands of Merchants that are their customers.
EQUITY
Have you incorporated, or formed any legal entity (like an LLC) yet?
Yes
What kind of entity and in what state or country was the entity formed?

What convinced you to apply to Y Combinator?
oothenigerian


'Convinced' is putting this lightly. My friend, <a href='https://medium.com/@oothenigerian'>Oo</a> literally sent an email, without my knowledge, to multiple YC partners, insisting that they check out Paystack. I remember opening my email, realising what I had been copied on, and screaming to myself something like 'Oh my God Oo, what have you done?!'
Luckily, <a href='https://twitter.com/mwseibel/with_replies'>Michael Siebel</a> (who would go on to become YC CEO), replied and kindly asked me to send over some more information. To this day, I don't think I've ever put more thought into a reply! 😂
How did you hear about Y Combinator?
been on hacker news since 2007
Shortly after I sent the application, I received a reply asking for further information.
Hi Shola,
Thanks for applying! A few questions for you.
1) Can you tell us more about the online consumer payments market in Nigeria and the other markets you’re looking at? What % of consumers pay with credit cards, verve money, etc.?
Last year, in Nigeria, about $43B was processed in Card transactions. But only about $0.4B were online transactions. So about 1% of cards were used online (up from 0.2% in 2006). However, E-commerce is experiencing enormous growth (from about US$ 35 million in 2012 to over US$ 550 million as of October 2014).
The general summary of the consumer payments market is that it’s growing fast due to increased mobile penetration and E-commerce adoption. Same can be said of Kenya (transaction volume doubled between 2010 to 2014) and South Africa (from $31B in 2009 to $57B in 2013). To put things in perspective, online payments is growing in Africa at about 26–30% annually compared to 9–16% in North America    Below are a few stats to answer the last part of the question
Credit/Debit Split: 3% Credit Card, 97% Debit Cards.
Card Scheme Split: Mastercard/Visa (30%), Verve (65%), Others (5%)
I got many of these numbers from KPMG's <a href='https://assets.kpmg.com/content/dam/kpmg/za/pdf/2016/09/Payment-Developments-in-Africa-2015.pdf'>Payment Developments in Africa Volume 1 2015 Report</a>. Fun fact: I would later go on to hire one of the people who worked on this report.
2) Can you tell use more about the experience using Stripe and Braintree in Nigeria? What do they and do they not support? Are there issues unique to your markets?
Firstly, Stripe and Braintree do not support Nigeria (or any other African country yet). A few merchants use them, but they need to register their companies in US or UK and then find a way to get the money back to Nigeria.
The unique issues to our markets are
Lots of middle men. The payment ecosystem in US is the Issuer (customer’s bank) , Acquirer ( Merchant’s Bank) and the Payment Gateway (Stripe), in Nigeria it’s the Issuer (customer’s Bank), Issuer Processor (third party service provider for the Customer’s bank), Acquirer (Merchant’s Bank), Acquirer’s Processor (Third Party service provider for the acquirer), Switch (central clearing system), Payment Gateway (Paystack)
Fragmented Payment Methods. Local Card Schemes (Verve, Genesis), International Card Schemes (Mastercard, Visa), Bank Accounts (like ACH), Mobile Money Wallets.
Overregulation — The Countries Regulator has put in different rules like 2-factor Authentication, Transaction Limits, e.t.c
Small correction: Most US banks also use third party service providers for issuer processing and acquirer processing.
3) Who else is working on your team?
I’ve worked with 4 top advisors to make Paystack happen.
Seun and I were classmates at University. He helps with the paperwork required for executing the banking partnerships and regulatory obligations.
Oo runs callbase.co, he’s spent a lot of time helping with the product design and overall vision.
[REDACTED]
Abis is a financial / Risk management consultant.
In a follow-up, YC forced the question of a co-founder, asking which of my advisors I would ask to join the team full time. After much thought I told them that Ezra Olubi would be my co-founder.
Please note: I hadn't asked <a href='https://twitter.com/0x'>Ezra</a> yet 😂
Luckily, he said yes 😀
4) Can you send us a graph of monthly transaction volume since you launched?
We have not launched yet, we’ve been piloting with a few merchants for 7 weeks. Here’s a graph of the live transactions we’ve done so far.
Man, I look at this graph and I can't stop laughing 😂 It's almost comical, but it was what we had - a whopping 22 transactions in our first month, and 318 transactions in our second.
Today, we do many multiples of this in minutes. It's good to look back and see where you've come from.
Apply to Y Combinator
So that was Paystack's YC application. I hope this was illuminating, or at the very least, entertaining :) 
If you'd like to hear more about how other African founders got into YC, 9 of them will sharing their stories at the <a href='https://www.eventbrite.com/e/y-combinator-lagos-meetup-tickets-37145958562'>Y Combinator Lagos Meetup</a>, which will take place at noon, on Saturday September 23rd, at the Paystack office in Ikeja GRA, Lagos.
I hope to meet you there.
Once more, the deadline for the applying to YC is 8 pm PT on October 3rd.

Building Paystack: Product Analytics
How we’re approaching product analytics at Paystack
Opemipo Aikomo
Product Designer, 					Paystack
On this page
Paystack’s mission is to provide the best payments experience for African merchants, and we’ve been at this for more than a year now. In that time, we’ve made a lot of (thankfully) good assumptions. But as we grow rapidly, we need to make more informed decisions about how to build our product. This involves implementing product analytics.
It might surprise you to realize that Paystack only recently started being more intentional about product analytics. Like many other startups, we didn’t pay attention to analytics early because:
Tunnel vision: We were very focused on pushing out the product and getting early customers that there was 'no time for anything else'.
Team size: User Experience (UX) is such an extensive field, and because our early design team was only one person, UX research seemed like something to consider after hiring a bigger design team.
Correct early assumptions: At the very early stages of our product, we were driven by a strong sense of intuition and smart assumptions, so analytics seemed unnecessary.
Benefits of analytics for a small startup
There’re numerous benefits to being intentional about analytics, even for small startups:
You can greatly improve your design process by observing how people use your product.
There’s a high likelihood of you discovering something about your product you never even considered.
Smart assumptions for product features are good, but informed decisions are much better.
Even if you don’t use the analytics data immediately, it’s really handy to collect for future work or another product.
Pivots!*
Before working on Instagram, founder Kevin Systrom spent months working on an app called Burbn. It was while reviewing Burbn’s analytics that he saw interesting user behaviour which resulted in the pivot to Instagram.

Great analytics tools for small startups
Here’re some of the tools we’ve been trying out at Paystack in our early experiments with becoming a more data-driven company.
Google Analytics Account — (Free) This is a simple analytics tracker.
Google Search Console — (Free) This helps you figure out how people find your site on the internet, and much more.
Fullstory Account — (Trial account). Fullstory is a tool that helps you better understand your customers’ experience of your product.
* Heap or Mixpanel are popular alternatives for Google Analytics or Fullstory
* Keep a checklist handy, so you can follow your progress as you implement analytics for your product
Analytics Checklist
Step 1: Setup Tracking
Google Analytics
Google Search Console
Fullstory
Step 2: Decide what to track
Highlight the call to actions on your app / landing page
List out the most important goals of your app / landing page
Step 3: Implement
Mark important actions as events
Create and track conversion goals
Step 1: Setup Tracking
Google Analytics is great for tracking how users navigate through your site (behaviour), and where your users come from (acquisition).
Google Search Console helps you figure out how people find your business on the internet. You can use this data to optimize your keywords, SEO, and much more.
Fullstory is more suited for when you want specific details about how people interact with your pages — what buttons they click or don’t, how they flow through you product, and more. Here’s a quick guide to setting up all these services:
Create your Google Analytics account, then follow the instructions to add to your application.
Signup and follow the instructions to add Fullstory to your app. Fullstory has a pretty neat on-boarding process so you’ll be guided through how to use it.
Finally, connect your analytics account with Search console. This helps you figure out how people search for and find your product on Google.
* Note: At Paystack, we created multiple account ids for the different concerns i.e. Landing page analytics ID is different from dashboard ID. This decision was made to keep the data clean.
* For single page applications, you might need to find a custom Google Analytics library to track pages. A simple search on Github will find you one. Fullstory works out of the box with any application.
Step 2: Deciding what to track

On to the next! Now that tracking is all set up, make a list of things that are important to track. It doesn’t have to be a long list, but it needs to be precise. Take a look at your app and landing page to decide the most important actions you want people to do.
For landing pages, this is usually evident in the call-to-action buttons. For example:
Landing Page: I want people to
Sign up
Use the demo
Contact Sales
Tracking analytics for your main application might be bit different, and usually your database will be able to give you insights into what people do with their accounts. For your application, you should be looking out for things that have to do with the user experience (UI/UX). A good way to decide what metrics to track is using Google’s HEART framework. For example
App: I want to know how people
Interact with the onboarding screens
Interact with the empty states
Interact with the upsell Calls-to-Action
Step 3: Implementation
By default, once integration is done, both Google Analytics and Fullstory provide rich dashboards that give you insights out of the box. If you’ve outlined what to track from Step 2 above though, then you need to actively note when these actions happen.
 			Paystack’s Fullstory dashboard default insights 		
Default Insights
The Fullstory dashboard highlights a lot of important things by default. So you can see session recordings, dead clicks, error clicks and browser distribution, etc.
Google Analytics also provides a ton of usage data right out of the box. You can play around with it to understand, read an explainer, or read a glossary.
Fullstory Tips
One important way to optimize your Fullstory data is to use unique IDs in your HTML to highlight all the important sections and buttons.
To go further, you can create segments and funnels.
Segments are questions you can ask from the tracked information e.g How many people that used the onboarding clicked on help later?
Funnels join segments together for deeper questions. e.g For the people from the question above, how many were on a mobile device?
Events (Google Analytics)
These are used to record user interaction with website element. Other services like Fullstory provide this data by default because they track every click and swipe. At Paystack though, we prefer to track our conversion and goals in Google Analytics.
As an example, we’ll be tracking one of the actions from Step 2. To track people signing up, we can use javascript to notify GA when the signup buttons are clicked. e.g
HTML:
<a class='button button--green' data-signup='Homepage Hero Button' href='https://dashboard.paystack.com/#/signup'>Get started for free</a>
<a class='button button--green' data-signup='Signup Tab Button' href='https://dashboard.paystack.com/#/signup'>Create Account</a>
Javascript:
var signupLinks = document.querySelectorAll('[data-signup]');
for (i = 0; i < signupLinks.length; i++) {
    signupLinks[i].addEventListener('click', function(event){
        event.preventDefault();
        var eventLabel = event.target.getAttribute('data-signup');
        var gaIsLoaded = window[window['GoogleAnalyticsObject'] || 'ga'];
        if (gaIsLoaded) {
            ga('send', 'event', {
                eventCategory: 'Signup',
                eventAction: 'click',
                eventLabel: eventLabel
            });
        }
        window.location = event.target.getAttribute('href');
    })
}
If you’re not technical, what we’ve done above is label our signup buttons based on their position on the page and record the 'Signup' event to Google Analytics when they are clicked.
Goals (Google Analytics)
This takes events one step further by tracking conversion. You can use this to track the metrics that directly affect the success of your business. Here’s an example story:
You want to know when people need help in your application
You implement an event every time the help button is clicked
You create a goal to see how many people do this over time
Now, you can progressively see how people are requesting help
When you redesign your dashboard, you want to know if worked i.e Less people need help
Goals can help you see if this really worked over time
 			Example Goal: How many people are creating a Paystack account 		
Further reading: Kissmetrics, About Goals
Done is better than perfect
You can implement only Step 1 and call it a day. You’ll still be collecting useful data you can use, and your dashboards will be able to give you insights.
Also, there’s no need to be pedantic about analytics, because as a small startup, you have to make difficult decisions about where you allocate your development time. You can start simple and keep refining this over time. The more insights you get, the better your events and goals will get.
We hope this look into how Paystack is approaching product analytics has proved illuminating. If you have analytics tips and tools that have worked for you, please feel free to share them with us via email or Twitter  ❤️✌🏿",blog

The road to ₦1 billion in monthly transaction volume at Paystack
A breakdown of Paystack's journey to the '₦1 billion in monthly transaction volume' milestone

The road to ₦1 billion in monthly transaction volume at Paystack
Last night, the Paystack team hit a major milestone: Nigerian customers are now using Paystack to pay over 1 billion Naira (~$3 million) to Nigerian merchants, every month, entirely online.
At exactly 9:56 PM (WAT) on the 25th of July, 2017; Paystack crossed a billion Naira processed in a single month. pic.twitter.com/cUGMWHWOgj
— Ezra 'God' Olubi. (@0x) July 25, 2017
We couldn’t be more thankful.
Why we share our numbers publicly
It’s become something of a tradition at Paystack to share our transaction volumes publicly. Why do we do this?
It’s certainly not because we’re trying to brag, or because we think the numbers are so much larger than our peers. At a little over a year and a half old, Paystack is actually a relatively new entrant into the Nigerian payments space. Many of our peers have been at this for a lot longer, and passed these milestones ages ago.
We do it for two main reasons:
Celebrating all wins, both big and small
We’re a tiny team with big dreams. 12 months ago there were about 5 people working at Paystack. Today we’re 18 people strong (and growing!), but the problem of payments in Nigeria is so daunting, that the bad days can sometimes outnumber the good. We consider it an important part of company culture to celebrate the wins.
Encouraging a culture of greater transparency and mutual accountability within the Nigerian startup community
Another value we hold dearly at Paystack is that of transparency. We’re inspired by the example of the folks at Buffer, whose CEO routinely shares detailed revenue numbers publicly.
We believe strongly that for African businesses to become the global behemoths we aspire to be, we need to set aside the culture of intense secrecy and share what we’re learning and how we’re doing.
Andela’s Celestine Omin says it well in this article about Building the African Software Engineering Ecosystem:
I love how companies in the valley, Europe and South East Asia are deliberately building their engineering culture. These companies do this through a couple of ways; tech talks, engineering blogs, open source, etc. They share their problems, pain points and solutions…While the Nigerian and African tech needs funding, the need for actual engineering collaboration and sharing cannot be over emphasised. If you’ve solved a major problem; optimisation, security, scalability, experimenting with a new tech, write about it. Share.While I’m not oblivious to the Dunning-Kruger effect, you will be surprised at how many people will learn and benefit from this gesture. Building out your own CI/CD pipeline? Write about it. Wrote an amazing configuration management for your servers? Share it. Talk!!! Found a new way to minimise latency by 3%? Write about it. Talk. Mitigated a DDoS? Write about it.We need more African tech startups writing about their processes, product design methodology, software engineering practises, opening up their APIs.
Could a competitor glean something about our strategy from our numbers? Probably! But we’re betting that we gain a lot more by being candid with our team and our community about how we’re doing. By setting the bar so high, it motivates us to put in 110% — when you know that your scorecard is going to be posted on Twitter for everyone to see, that has a way of kicking you in the butt to do more 🙂
When more African businesses share, we all become better. We all benefit. We believe this strongly as a company, which is why we intend to be an example.
The transaction that got us to the ₦1 billion/month milestone
Here’re a few fun details about the transaction that got us to our latest milestone: it was a payment of ₦6,000 made in Ikoyi using a Mastercard Debit Card, issued by GT Bank.
The road to ₦1 billion/month transaction volume
Here’s a timeline of previous transaction volume timelines.
Thank you
We can’t say this enough: thank you to our merchants for trusting us with their business, to the entire Paystack team for working tirelessly to get us to this point, to investors for the vote of confidence, and finally, to an entire universe of friends and well-wishers who inspire us to do more.
You give us purpose, and we’ll need your support to help us reach our next milestone: ₦10 billion in monthly transaction volume 😎

Why we spent a year building a 'Pay with Bank Account' feature for Nigerian merchants
All the details about Paystack's 'Pay with bank' feature that lets customers pay businesses with just their account number
Abdulrahman Jogbojogbo
Product Marketer, 					Paystack
On this page
Paystack recently launched Pay with Bank, a new feature that allows customers of Paystack merchants to pay without a card, using just a bank account number.
It took us nearly a year to get Pay with Bank right. After numerous initial attempts, we finally cracked it (the actual engineering work took only a few weeks once we solved it), and we couldn’t be more thrilled by the overwhelmingly positive response!
Amazing! Worked perfectly with Zenith Bank! https://t.co/qxI9sa4Quu
— Mark Essien (@markessien) June 8, 2017
Recently, we saw a transaction that perfectly illustrates why we devoted significant resources towards building this feature for Nigerian merchants.
This payment timeline tells a simple, but powerful story.
Let’s break this down.
A prospective customer wants to pay a Paystack merchant…
Our hero, a prospective customer— let’s call her Temitope — attempts to pay a Paystack merchant with her debit card.
Unfortunately, her card was declined due to a 3DS error, which means that her card failed to pass automated risk checks 🙁
If this merchant had been using a payment processor other than Paystack, this would have been the end of the story. Temi would have abandoned cart, and the merchant would have lost the sale.
This is what happens instead.
Pay with Bank to the rescue
Instead of abandoning the purchase, Temi chooses to try Paystack’s Pay with Bank feature!
She quickly fills in her details in a few seconds and tries again….
Success!
Temi makes her payment, closes the page, and goes on with her life.
Temi is pleased to receive the service she wants, and the merchant just earned a new customer who would otherwise have walked away 🙌🏿
Obsessed with making Nigerian merchants more money
At Paystack, we ask ourselves one main question every day: 'How can we help Nigerian merchants make more money?'
Literally every single decision we make as a company revolves around answering this question, and we won’t rest until every business in Nigeria has simple, elegant tools to take their company to the next level.
One more thing…
By the way, you know that payment timeline? That timeline is available to every Paystack merchant.
This is what the full transaction page looks like.
Paystack’s transaction page tells you everything you need to know about a customer’s payment, including:
How long the customer spent on the page
What device they used to pay
How many times they tried to pay
The kind of card they used to pay
The name and country of their bank
Lots more!

Introducing Pay with Bank
A look at a new channel for Paystack merchants to receive payments from their customers
Abdulrahman Jogbojogbo
Product Marketer, 					Paystack
On this page
We’re excited to announce that customers of Paystack merchants can now pay directly from their bank accounts!
It’s really simple for customers to use this new payment option: the customer enters their bank account number, they get an OTP from their bank, and they hit pay. That’s it!
Try Pay with Bank for yourself with this demo: paystack.com/demo
                
Here’re 3 ways this new feature helps Paystack merchants make more money
Customers who can’t pay with a card for any reason now have another way to pay
This is a great option for corporate customers who can only pay from corporate bank accounts
Some customers don’t like to enter their card details online. Now they have another way to pay
Supported banks
Customers can now pay directly from the following banks:
Access Bank
Diamond Bank
FCMB
GTB (via internet banking)
Fidelity Bank
Wema Bank
Zenith Bank
How to enable Pay with Bank
To enable Pay with Bank for your Paystack account, you’ll need to turn it on from your Dashboard. You’ll find it in in the Preferences tab of the Settings section (you can use this direct link to get to the page).
What’s the charge on payments made via bank account?

Payments under NGN 2,500 = 1.5% of purchase amount
Payments of NGN 2,500 or more = 1.5% + NGN 100
The charge is capped at NGN 2,000.
What is the transaction limit on Pay with Bank?
The maximum amount that a customer can pay directly from their bank account is entirely dependent on a limit that has been established by their bank.
A customer who attempts to do a transaction above their limit will see a 'Transfer limit exceeded' error. To solve this, the customer will need to contact their account officer at their bank and request that their limit should be increased.
Have any questions about Pay with Bank?

Introducing Payment Requests (now Invoices)
A new way for Paystack merchants to directly bill and invoice customers.
Abdulrahman Jogbojogbo
Product Marketer, 					Paystack
On this page
A lot of businesses on Paystack provide tailored services to their customers. This creates the need to request payments directly. Paystack provides a good number of ways to integrate and get paid, but sometimes, it’s not that deep, and you just want to say 'Hey customer, Pay me XXX'.
We launched Payment Pages last year as a solution for collections. With this feature, anyone could set up a page and get a link to share with their customers. It turned out really well, and it let people jump right into Paystack without having to go through the ease of using the API or any of the plugins. But in many cases, it still wasn’t optimized.
Collections vs Direct Billing
There are many situations for which Payment Pages are ideal. Ticket Payments? Check. Group contributions? Check. Donations? Check again! Across all these use cases, it is clear that the feature is great for when you want to collect money from many people.
For direct customer billing however, it’s not the best. So we’re introducing another way: Payment Requests. What’s peculiar?
Send directly to one customer. Choose or create a customer to request payment from.
Let them know why you’re requesting payment. For goods you sold? For a service you offered? Include that message.
Optionally create and attach an invoice. Create professionally designed invoices to attach to your request, if you need a little more formality.
Reminders. We automatically remind the customer not to forget your payment. But in case you need a little more fire, you can send the reminders yourself.
Know when you’re paid. We send you an email when the customer settles the bill.
How to start requesting
On your dashboard, go to the Payment Requests Menu on the sidebar to start making requests. You can send a simple request or create a more professional one, complete with an invoice.

You can also read the API documentation to request payments from your app. We’ve also added webhook events for payment requests.
We’ve rolled out Payment Requests to all users today. If you notice any quirks or have any feedback, please send us an email at >em class='markup--em markup--p-em'> or send us a tweet @paystack. We look forward to hearing from you.",blog

Internships are hard, and we found out the practical way
Lessons learnt from our first Internship at Paystack
Abdulrahman Jogbojogbo
Product Marketer, 					Paystack
On this page
In February, we decided to start an internship. It was to be a two-fold experience. As a small startup, we wanted to teach what we had learnt, as a way of giving back. Also, we wanted to use this opportunity to create a framework for our internships moving forward.
We started with a design internship that was to last for 10 weeks. We’d take three people, give them design training, space and internet, and pay them monthly, only to learn. Internally, we had a few goals
Provide a conducive environment for the interns to work.
Create a separate curriculum for intern work so they can learn independent of our fire-fighting.
Discover individual intern strength, and help the interns move further along respective paths.
Create a structure for internships that can be duplicated.
Three months later, and our first internship is complete! We didn’t spend as much time with the interns as we’d have wished to, but we managed to help the interns improve… a lot. Post-internship conversations with the interns showed a few things
We should have created regular tasks and exercises for the interns. Operating a free schedule may have been nice, but they were looking forward to being hammered with tasks.
Regardless, the interns all discovered what aspect of design they were better at and moved in that direction.
The interns felt like they belonged, and appreciated that they could relate with everyone at the office. That’s an A for us on culture.
Free lunch cannot be over emphasized.
We’ll definitely be having another internship soon, and this time better prepared. Thank you Adewale Akande, Kache and OT ™ for an incredible experience teaching you and learning from you.

Product Design Internship
The thinking behind Paystack's Product Design internship
Opemipo Aikomo
Product Designer, 					Paystack
On this page
We’re interested in building a culture of design in Nigeria. The technology scene is becoming bigger, and we need to help create designers that can produce digital products that really make the cut. This is everything you need to know about Paystack’s design internship program.

The low-down
Many technology startups require a lot of portfolio work in any field of design to consider internship applicants. On the other hand, we realize design is only just on the come up here in Nigeria, thus:
This is a learning experience, nothing more. We only expect interns to learn fast and help one other.
We’re willing to teach people with an eye for design — with or without portfolios.
Interns can be as optionally remote as they want — whatever is best for their learning process.
It will be a paid internship.
This internship will last for 10 weeks from February 2016.
We’ll be taking on three interns in our first cycle.
On Acceptance
Acceptance into the internship programme involves the following exercises:
Design exercise: This is to filter applicants for people who can work with deadlines, and think through tasks. You can do this in any medium of choice.
Phone Screen: The people who make it past the exercise will be called to discuss
Background
Thinking behind the design exercise
Other portfolio work, if any
Reasons for choosing Paystack
Availability
App Critique: Intended to analyze product thinking skills, applicants will be asked to critique a popular Nigerian application.
On Rejection
Not everyone will get in, and we’ll try to let everyone know why. Applicants may be rejected because they
Didn’t meet the requirements at any point in the process.
Met the requirements but weren’t as good as other applicants — there’s a limit to how many people we can take on.
Rejected applicants will have a chance to join a mailing list to be sent all the exercises and learning materials over the internship period (10 weeks). There will be no supervision though.",blog

A year from launch, we rebranded and upgraded our website

Paystack is almost a year old since we went beta in January. In this period of time, the product has evolved to better solve the problem of online payments. However, we’ve not done a good job of telling our story and documenting our progress. This rebrand is a step in that direction.
The Brand
Paystack aims to be super easy, yet very trustworthy. That’s a tricky dynamic, but we’re lucky to have a name that reflects that. The word 'stack' fits tight and snug into the concept of trusting easy. A stack is an easy thing to create, yet stable when it all comes together.
The new logo is a 'P' just like in the old logo, but this time it’s made up of a stack. You see it and you just get it — it’s a perfect metaphor. The carved rounded edges soften the form, to look friendlier without being too playful and cliché.
The good guys at Da Design Studio helped us create this, and we’re super proud of the results. To read more about our new brand, download the synopsis here
The Website
The old website worked for us as entrants to the space, but with time it said nothing about how we’ve grown nor the features built into Paystack.
We rebuilt the website from scratch to showcase our depth, and to be modular and extensible as we add new features. Over the next few months, we’ll be adding more sections (e.g a much needed help section).
If you care about the details of the new design, and the design decision that went into it, we have it documented here.
The new website is live now at paystack.com.",blog

Ingredients for the new Paystack site
A breakdown of how the new Paystack site was built

Product Designer, 					Paystack
On this page
For a couple of weeks now, I’ve been working on a website refresh for Paystack. I got my friend Onyekachi to help, and it’s been quite interesting. I decided to write about the process, but couldn’t figure out how best to. So I decided to just write pointers. I’ll be sharing
Optimizations: Decisions we made regarding code, conventions, plugins and best practices
Cool Stuff: Particular design elements that I really like about the final product
Inspiration: Sites I looked at endlessly, and learned from to make this a reality
Source code for anyone who cares to learn from it
Optimizations
No jquery, no bootstrap
Eventually, we realized this wasn’t as crazy an idea. Most things we wrote were easily done in vanilla js.
Clean, 'stressful' HTML with BEM
I decided we try some CSS architecture and we chose to use BEM. It’s the more popular choice.
Pro: The code is really nice.  Con: Oh hell, it’s really stressful. And then I decided all the CSS code must be alphabetical. *sigh, stresss*
Animations in code — with AnimatePlus
I wrote all the animations with CSS transitions using AnimatePlus, created by Benjamin De Cock (From Stripe). Hopefully one day, I’ll make something so useful.
Iconography: the noun project, figma, svgs
I created an icon sheet myself! I have a Noun Project subscription, so I searched for icons myself, then recreated or optimized them.
I was going to use SVG code, but I couldn’t optimize it enough to keep the code clean. I don’t know enough about these things. So I just used SVG Sprites for most of the icons and loaded the others directly.
Overall, I’m really impressed with how I managed to create the site using the most minimal external dependencies. Stressful, but worth it.
Cool Stuff
 			Company page 		
Homepage Animation: The animated storyboard on the homepage was written all with CSS animations. Storyboarding and timing it was rather interesting and took about a week to perfect.
Stack animations: Weirdly, these never made it to the site. I used blocks to create shapes for each section, all using CSS. I’ll be sharing some gifs on Dribbble soon.
Snapchat About Page: I had this weird idea to put a Snapchat-like video on our about page that would be updated every time someone has a birthday (while we’re still small) or when we hit milestones. Didn’t turn out too shabbily.
Inspiration
I decided to share all the sites I looked at endlessly to form my ideas in making this website a reality.
Hero animation was inspired by universe.openai.com and bold.co.
Dropdown styling was inspired by reuters.tv.
The lines on the cards were inspired by Plaid.
This is a link to all 25 or so sites I was inspired by.

Behind the feature — Payment pages
Exploring the Payment Pages feature
Abdulrahman Jogbojogbo
Product Marketer, 					Paystack
On this page
We’re starting a series on the blog where we’ll share the stories behind some of the features at Paystack. The beauty of having a product with over 6,000 signups is that you get to speak with so many people and that gives you a good idea of what people want. Every feature has a story, and today, we’ll reflect on how we built the payment page feature.
Shola: Sometime in January, I was speaking with a customer and she mentioned how she wanted to use Paystack for her business but she needed to do it herself without involving a developer. Do you know Javascript? No. PHP? No. She ended the call by saying Paystack might not be as easy as we think. I swallowed that, accepted the challenge and spent the next few hours brainstorming with the other members of the product team, then Ezra and Ope. One thing was clear, there were so many people like this lady that needed to accept payments without contracting a developer and the earlier we found a way to help them, the better for us all. In 2 weeks, we built an MVP, piloted it, and launched it a blog post.
We spent the next few months getting feedback and monitoring usage. Sometime in August, we released an update. Today, the feature is growing fast and currently accounts for 5% of our transaction volume. Over 260 businesses have received payments using Payment pages and adoption continues to increase.
 			Growth of Payment Pages 		
Here are some nifty things you can do with our Payment pages:
Collect all the information you need: Request addresses, date of birth, gender, basically any information you want to get from your customers.
 			Set custom fields 		
Memorable payment pages: Use custom URLs to create pages your customers can remember. And yes, you can also update the URLs of your existing payment pages.
 			Custom URLs 		
Payment pages with subscriptions: Your customers can subscribe for your recurring plans via payment pages.
Redirects and success messages: Redirect your customers somewhere else after a successful payment. Or just set a custom thank you message.

Navigating regulatory scrutiny: building trust and driving growth in Fintech.
byTosin Eniolorunda
As business leaders, we often move from decision to decision, event to event, leaving little room for reflection. Yet, it’s in those reflective moments that clarity emerges, revealing opportunities and risks we might otherwise miss.
Earlier this year, I jotted down two words as guiding themes for 2024: growth and compliance. Looking back, those words have proven to be critical to navigating the evolving dynamics of our industry.
One of the defining shifts this year has been the intensified regulatory scrutiny in Nigeria’s fintech space. While challenging—and often compounded by media reports that are, more often than not, inaccurate—this heightened oversight is essential. It safeguards consumers, prevents financial crimes, and ensures the long-term stability of our ecosystem.
Throughout this journey, a few key lessons have stood out. First, transparency is essential for building trust. Like any organisation, we’ve faced challenges. What has mattered most is how we’ve responded—by acknowledging our missteps, learning from them, and making necessary changes. This openness has been critical in strengthening trust across all stakeholders.
Second, we view regulators as partners in building a strong and reliable financial ecosystem. While navigating regulatory processes can sometimes be tough, our focus has been on fostering constructive dialogue, providing feedback, and working collaboratively to shape frameworks that balance innovation and stability.
Finally, a stronger regulatory framework benefits everyone. For consumers, it means increased protection and confidence in the services they use. For businesses, it ensures a fair playing field and encourages innovation through clear and consistent guidelines. And for the industry as a whole, it promotes long-term stability and resilience.
At Moniepoint, we remain committed to this journey. While the path isn’t always easy, we see it as an opportunity to mitigate risks, unlock innovation, and expand sustainably. Because when the ecosystem thrives, we all thrive.

Why Should You File Your Taxes Early as a Small Business in Nigeria?
byChidinma Nwonye
Filing your tax early as a small business comes with numerous benefits that can easily be missed out on if overlooked. The Federal Inland Revenue Service often emphasises the importance of filing taxes early to avoid issues like identity theft and penalties. 
While filing your taxes early might seem complicated, it is a smart decision every business owner should make to boost credibility and proper financial management. 
In this guide, we'll explore what you need to know before filing your taxes with the FIRS, the steps, and the benefits included.
What Does it Mean to File Your Tax as a Business in Nigeria?
Tax filing is an obligation that every working person in Nigeria must fulfil to the government. It involves reporting your expenses, income, and tax liabilities to the FIRS to enable the government to provide public services. 
In Nigeria, every employed individual must file taxes after the end of a tax year (March 31), while self-employed persons/businesses do so six months after an accounting year. Furthermore, taxes such as the Value Added Tax should be filed before the 21st of every month to avoid missing deadlines and penalties. 
Small businesses with a turnover of less than N25 million are not required to pay Company Income Taxes. They are, however, obligated to pay other taxes such as VAT, withholding taxes, stamp duties, pay-as-you-earn, capital gains tax, etc. 
'Understanding the type of business you run, be it a sole proprietorship, Limited liability company, Partnership, etc, enables you to file your taxes correctly.'
Why Should You File Your Taxes Early?
Filing your taxes early with the FIRS as a business in Nigeria offers you many benefits, some of which include the following;
1. You can Avoid Legal Penalties
One of the major risks of filing your taxes late as a business owner is the accumulation of penalties the FIRS imposes. 
These penalties, which can add up to 5% of unpaid taxes monthly, can drain your business resources and cause you to spend more than budgeted. You can easily avoid these legal penalties by filing your taxes promptly and in an organized manner.
2. Proper Financial Planning
The ability to predict your business's cash flow is ideal for making sound financial decisions. By filing your taxes early, you can better plan your business expenses and tax estimates for the future without disrupting your day-to-day operations. 
You can also claim any refunds that the FIRS may owe you after an audit and use them as extra cash to run your business. 
3. Unlock Incentives and Tax Refunds
Sometimes, the government can offer incentives or refunds for your business if you comply with tax policies. By filing your taxes early enough, you can qualify for these benefits and enjoy the extra financial rewards.
4. Avoid Tax Identity Theft
Often, scammers can use your details, such as your TIN, to file taxes falsely under your name, claim benefits, and keep the refunds. These scammers typically try to file the taxes early enough, even before you can file a legitimate return. 
Research by an NGO, the Anti-Corruption Agencies of Nigeria, states that Nigerians have lost an estimated $18 billion in internet fraud and non-payment of taxes. Fortunately, you can avoid such scams and stay informed of your tax activities by filing your taxes early and properly.
5. It Helps You Keep Track of your business Goals and Reports
Filing your taxes on time gives you a clear picture of your business' performance, profit/loss reports, and general overview. 
By properly understanding your business, goals, and cash flows, you can better plan for the next tax year and make adequate preparations and modifications.

What Do I Need to File My Taxes as a Small Business in Nigeria?
byChidinma Nwonye
Filing your taxes as a small business owner in Nigeria might seem like a headache, but it doesn't have to be! Paying taxes in Nigeria, regardless of your business size, is an obligation, and failure to do so comes with consequences like penalties, heavy fines, or a total shutdown. 
You might ask, 'What do I need to file my taxes as a small business in Nigeria?' We've got you covered! In this article, we'll explore the documents you need to file your taxes, the various types of taxes, and how to properly file your taxes. 
Do Small Businesses Pay Taxes in Nigeria?
Yes, small businesses pay taxes in Nigeria just like their larger counterparts, and the government uses these taxes at various levels to provide public amenities. 
The types of taxes small businesses pay range from value-added taxes(VAT) to pay-as-you-earn, capital gains tax, withholding taxes, stamp duties, etc. 
It is, therefore, essential for you to have a proper understanding of the type of business you run so as to file your taxes properly.
Who do Businesses Pay Taxes to in Nigeria?
In Nigeria, businesses and individuals pay taxes to the government at any of the three levels, i.e., the Federal, State, and Local government. Let's simplify this further;
1. The Federal Inland Revenue Service (FIRS)
The FIRS is the federal government's central tax-collecting body in Nigeria. It is responsible for collecting taxes such as VAT, company income tax(CIT), stamp duty, capital gain tax, and others. 
2. State Inland Revenue Services (SIRS)
A state's inland revenue service collects taxes at the country's state level. Each state has its own SIRS body that collects taxes from various businesses within its jurisdiction. The types of taxes the state collects include Business premises tax, Personal income Tax, Development levies, and so on.
3. Local Government Revenue Committees (LGRCs)
At the local government level in Nigeria, the LGRCs are responsible for collecting taxes from businesses under their jurisdiction. Some of the rates and levies they collect include motor park levies, kiosks and shop rates, merriment and road closure levies, refuse disposal public convenience levies, etc.

5 Business Taxes in Nigeria
The type of tax you pay in Nigeria as a business owner depends on your type of business, location, revenue, and size. Let's explore seven common taxes you're likely to encounter in Nigeria. 
1. Company Income Tax (CIT)
The FIRS charges taxes known as CIT on the revenue of limited liability companies in Nigeria. The amount payable as CIT for a company depends on its yearly turnover:
Companies with a turnover of less than N25 million are not required to pay CIT.
Companies with a turnover of N25 million to N100 million are required to pay 20% CIT.
Companies with a turnover of over N100 million must pay 30% CIT.
As a business, you are required to file your annual CIT returns and pay them within the last six months of your financial year. Furthermore, failure to do so on time comes with a penalty of 25,000 naira fine in the initial month and 5,000 naira for each following month.
2. Value Added Tax (VAT)
This type of tax can also be referred to as a sales tax, and it's a type of consumption tax every Nigerian business owner deals with. A VAT refers to levies imposed on goods and services sold to the public by businesses. 
However, VAT isn't applied to all items sold, and some exemptions include pharmaceutical and medical products, basic food items, agricultural produce, educational materials, etc. Not paying your VAT comes with a penalty of 5% yearly plus interest, a non-compliance fine of N10,000 and a subsequent N5,000 monthly.
3. Personal Income Tax (PIT)
A personal income tax is levied on the earnings of individuals living in Nigeria. Additionally, as a business owner, you are legally required to pay a PIT on your business revenue. 
Also, you are obligated to deduct a PAYE (Pay As You Earn) from your employees' salaries and remit it to the relevant tax body before the 10th of every month. The amount you pay for your PIT depends on your income bracket, and it's within the range of 7% to 24%. 
4. Stamp Duty Tax
The government imposes tax on the transfer of legal documents and instruments, such as buildings, homes, patents, copyrights, and securities. 
Stamp duty is levied on instruments that must be stamped within 40 days of their initial execution, and the amount depends on the type of instrument. Different instruments have varying stamp duties, such as fixed and ad valorem rates, which increase with the transaction's value.
What Documents are Required to File Taxes in Nigeria
The type of taxes you pay as a business owner in Nigeria depends on the type of your business and its specific tax. Nevertheless, to file any type of tax, here is the list of documents you'll need;
Tax identification number (TIN) or RC number.
Audited financial statements comprising profit/loss statements, financial position and notes.
Completed tax return forms.
Capital allowance schedules with a detailed breakdown of capital allowances claimed on carrying asset classes.
Tax computation schedule showing the reconciliation of profits to taxable profits and all adjustments
Tax exemption and compliance certificates in cases of tax reliefs and exemptions
Withholding tax credit notes for deducted taxes on the company's income.
Supporting documents/ schedules like the previous year's losses carried forward, claimed deduction evidence, etc.
How to File Your Taxes as a Small Business in Nigeria
To properly file your business tax return in Nigeria, simply follow the steps below;
Gather all your required documents.
Download and fill the applicable tax forms for manual filing, such as Form C08A, C08B, C08C, OR C08D. If you are filing electronically, you can fill out these forms on the portal.
Login to the FIRS self-filing system to file your tax returns
Properly report your sources of income and claim any eligible reliefs or deductions.
Accurately calculate your taxable income and tax liability.
Ensure that you obtain an acknowledgement or receipt for your records.
Quote your TIN correctly on your tax forms and payments. A valid TIN makes you eligible for tax clearance certificates.

A peek behind our data curtains - meet our IT & Data privacy auditor
byChidinma Enemanna
So, obviously, we can't give you an actual peek behind the curtain for -privacy reasons -but here's a bit of context: in today’s data-driven world, our digital footprints are everywhere, and safeguarding that information has never been more critical. Financial institutions, in particular, are heavily regulated because they handle some of the most sensitive data out there. But who actually ensures that companies are keeping our information safe?
This is where an IT & Data Privacy Auditor comes to play  —a role you probably don’t hear about as much as finance auditors but is equally essential. This time, I sat down with Moniepoint’s digital gatekeeper, Abdulganeey, to get a closer look at how he protects our systems from the inside out.
Here’s how my conversation with Abdulganeey went: 
How would you explain what you do to a layman? 
Imagine going to a Moniepoint business with your ATM card to make a payment. You see the business owner using a small terminal to help you with your transaction, but there’s a lot more happening behind that terminal than meets the eye. That’s where technology comes in: the behind-the-scenes work ensures your transaction is secure, fast, and compliant with regulations.
Simply put, a series of 'services' (or checks) happen in the background when you hand over your card. For example, once you enter your PIN, there’s a process to verify it’s correct before the transaction can proceed. Think of it as different 'checks' or 'approvals' happening in a split second to ensure everything is working securely and accurately.
My role is to ensure that all these technological systems and services operate securely, meet regulatory standards, and protect user data. For instance, when people use Moniepoint, they share sensitive information like card details and PINs. So, we follow rules like PCI DSS (for card transaction security), ISO standards (for general tech security), CBN regulations (from Nigeria’s Central Bank), and Nigerian data privacy laws. Each of these is a set of rules that help protect the data and keep everything running smoothly.
Finally, I also help ensure that only the right Moniepoint staff can access certain parts of the system. For example, if someone only needs to view information, they shouldn’t have permission to make changes or access other sensitive parts of the system. It’s about keeping things secure and organised to protect the technology and customer data as best as possible.

So, what’s the coolest part of being an IT & Data Privacy Auditor? 
What is the coolest part of being an IT and data Privacy Auditor? Honestly, it's the respect and authority that come with the role. You know, when people hear 'auditor,' it can be a bit intimidating. But there’s also a certain respect tied to it. Because of my role, I can approach anyone in the organisation to ask for the information I need, and by virtue of what we call the audit charter, they have to provide it. 
The audit charter is essentially a document that allows auditors to request information whenever necessary. So, in a way, it’s a bit of a 'flex.' I can simply say, 'I need this information,' and they’re obliged to help. It’s an interesting aspect of the role because it ensures we have access to everything we need to keep systems secure and compliant, and no one can turn down an audit request!
Oh wow! But are there times when you feel people don’t understand the importance of what you do? 
Honestly, data privacy is the part of my role that often feels most overlooked. I've had discussions with colleagues, especially those in operations, who don’t fully grasp its importance. 
Here’s a simple example to illustrate it: when you apply for a job, you’re considered a 'data subject.' This means you have significant rights over how your data is handled, though many people don’t realise just how much control they have. 
For instance, as a data subject, you could ask the employer to avoid using automated systems to review your application and request manual processing instead. If they disregard this and still use automation, you’d have grounds to take legal action and likely win. 
This example highlights the power of consent, an aspect of data privacy that often gets underestimated. Whenever someone shares personal information, they should be asked for consent, clarifying who can access or process it and under what conditions. However, many people don’t realise these rights, which is why data privacy deserves more attention and respect.
Before processing anyone’s data, we usually look out for key factors like consent, legitimate interest, public interest, performance of contract, legal obligation, and vital interest. A practical example of us at Moniepoint is our careers page. If you apply for a job on the careers page, you will see the 'GDPR consent.' This allows Moniepoint to use the applicants' data for recruitment purposes. 
Talking about Moniepoint and being compliant, we also ensure that we have all the needed certifications such as the Nigerian Data Protection Commission (NDPC) certification and ISO certifications. This shows that we are consistently vigilant about our data privacy practices. 


Interesting. I know that you collaborate extensively with various teams, so what teams/departments are your 'go-to partner in crime' for keeping data secure?
In my role, I collaborate closely with several core departments to effectively address data privacy and security issues. My go-to partners for fighting data breaches are primarily the Operations team, which includes the Network and Infrastructure team, and the Information Security team. They play a critical role in implementing security measures and maintaining the integrity of our systems.
I also frequently work with the Compliance team to ensure we adhere to all relevant regulations and standards. Legal is another important department, especially when we need to discuss Service Level Agreements (SLAs) and the legal implications of data handling. Additionally, I engage with the People Operations team to address controls from a staff perspective.
While I often interact with these teams, note that there's no department we don’t collaborate with in some capacity. However, the frequency and depth of collaboration are strongest with the teams I mentioned, particularly when it comes to proactively preventing data breaches and ensuring the security of our systems.
Let’s talk about our customers. How would you say your work helps our customers sleep better at night? 
My work directly contributes to our customers' peace of mind by ensuring their personal information is handled with the utmost care and security. In the financial sector, we often collect sensitive data, including customers’ dates of birth, home addresses, BVN, and NIN, so implementing robust controls is essential.
One of the key processes we have in place is user access review. This involves evaluating which staff members have access to sensitive customer information and to what extent. By examining their roles against the permissions they hold, we can determine if their access is appropriate. This role-based access control helps us restrict access to sensitive data only to those who truly need it for their job functions. 
By taking these measures, we not only safeguard our systems but also reassure our customers that their data is not just collected but protected. This level of diligence in data management helps instil confidence in our customers, allowing them to have peace of mind knowing that we are committed to preventing any misuse of their information.
To wrap up, if your life were to be a spy movie what movie would it be? Or if your life were to have a theme song, what would it be? 
If my life were to be a spy movie, it would resemble Captain America. Just like Captain America, my job revolves around security and protecting people. He’s always looking out for others and ensuring their safety, which aligns closely with my role in IT and data privacy.
As for a theme song, I'm having a bit of trouble recalling specific security-related songs, but I think something that embodies protection and vigilance would fit perfectly. It’s a tough call, but any song that highlights themes of heroism and safeguarding others would resonate with my mission in my work.


Away from work now, when you’re not fighting data breaches, how do you unwind? 
When I'm not busy fighting data breaches, I usually unwind by sticking to my phone. I have a keen interest in technology news, especially developments in artificial intelligence, which I find particularly exciting. I make an effort to stay updated on what's happening in the tech world and in Nigeria, even though I'm not always that interested in local news.
I also enjoy playing games, although I tend to get tired of them quickly. Overall, I find that keeping connected with technology helps me relax and stay engaged with my interests outside of work.

Thank you Abdulganeey! This was a delightful conversation!

5 Black Friday Ideas for Small Businesses in 2024
byChidinma Nwonye
Did you know that in 2022, shoppers spent a whopping $211.7 billion during the Black Friday season? 
This is why small business owners worldwide leverage Black Friday as an opportunity to boost sales. But here's a heads-up! The massive sales don't just happen by chance. 
Despite the promo codes and marketing strategies, you need a reliable and speedy payment option to receive and make payments. 
Let's explore five practical Balck Friday marketing strategies you can explore this year. But firstly, where did Black Friday and Cyber Monday originate from?
Black Friday and Cyber Monday Brief History.
Various stories surround the origin of Black Friday, with the word 'black' having varying meanings. 
A common narration describes this season as the period after Thanksgiving when businesses would record a profit boost (marked as black in accounting) after a massive year-round loss (marked by red). 
Another generally accepted tale tells of a situation in Philadephia in the 1950s when huge crowds of people would rush into the city in anticipation of the big Army-Navy football. This ultimately created traffic jams and chaos, which the police would try really hard to control. 
In today's retail world, people refer to the last Friday of November and the following weekend; for 2024, Black Friday will happen on the 29th of November. On the other hand, Cyber Monday is the first Monday following Black Friday and is used to spread promos and offers online.
Black Friday Marketing Ideas for Your Small Business
1. Organise a Friendly Black Friday Contest
Are you looking for a way to attract customers this Black Friday? You can easily create a light contest to spark potential customer engagement and interest. 
The winner then gets to win a free product from your store or a service your business provides. A great idea for a friendly contest can be asking your customers to pick a favourite product from your store and share how they plan to use it on instagram. 
They can then get friends to like the post, comment, and follow your business page. This ultimately boosts traffic and awareness for your brand and improves customer interaction.
2. Create Timed Deals
Most people dislike the idea of missing out on something trending. This is why, as a business owner, you can leverage the sense of urgency on deals that motivate people to buy. Various ways you can utilise time limits as a strategy for your Black Friday sales include;
Early bird deals: 'The early bird gets the fattest worm.' Yup! You can reward your earliest shoppers with a special discount, which eventually attracts a lot of people to your site or shop, especially within a limited timeframe.
Deals by the hour: A good way to make people' stalk' your website is to offer a special sales deal that changes hourly. For instance, you could offer different discounts on different products at different hours of the day.
Deals by the day: You can elevate your hourly deals by offering special discounts on the days leading up to Black Friday. 
Final Chance deals: Here, you can offer special deals to customers who didn't have a chance to purchase before the limit windows.
You can easily promote your timed deals via email marketing, social media channels, or a website with countdowns that increase the hype. 
3. Make use of Email marketing
Promoting special discounts and deals through newsletters can easily expand your email subscriber list. This way, you make it easy for potential customers to make desired purchases by clicking a button on their email. 
4. Offer Free Gifts with Customer Purchases
Most people love to receive gifts, and you can take advantage of that feeling to boost your Black Friday sales. By simply offering an incentive of a free gift item for every purchase they make, you can increase engagement and referrals to friends. 
You can play around with a mystery gift item to boost expectations, complimentary gift items with purchases, small product samples, and free-choice gifts by customers. 
5. Use Speedy Mobile Payment Options
With Black Friday sales comes an increased number of payment transactions. Unfortunately, this can take a toll on payment providers, as there might be delays and glitches during transactions. 
You can stay ahead of the competition by using fast and reliable payment platforms such as a point of sale terminal (POS), and personal and business banking accounts. 
Moniepoint MFB offers business owners and shoppers business and personal bank accounts they can use to pay and receive speedy, reliable, and safe transfers.
On a Final Note

How to Get Funding for Your Business
byChidinma Nwonye
It all begins with a 'light-bulb' idea for a solution that meets customers' needs. A business is born and sells products or services either in a traditional brick-and-mortar manner or digitally. 
However, as brilliant as any business is, it requires money to grow and sustain itself. Unfortunately, this is hard to come by, especially for small businesses in developing countries like Nigeria. 
In fact, the International Finance Corporation (IFC) reveals that 40% of small and medium enterprises (MSMEs) in developing countries have unmet financing needs of $5.2 trillion yearly. 
Whether you wish to raise business funds from your friends and family or via a small business loan, youre in the right place. 
Understanding Your Business Needs
Are you in the early stages of your business, or have you been operating for a while and are now considering an expansion? You should be clear about your fundraising purpose. 
Draft your necessities into the 'wait' and the 'need' lists; this will help you figure out your business's necessities. Additionally, it'll enable you to avoid unnecessary debt and, on the flip side, underestimation. 
A major tip to remember is to properly analyse your cash flow and figure out how much money you'll require for the next milestone. 
Some typical business expenses and questions concerning them to consider before seeking funding include;
Payroll: Figure out how many employees you plan to hire, how much you aim to pay them, and how many you may need to start making a profit.
Licensing, taxes, and permits: As a business owner, you need to understand the various permits, licenses, and taxes you must pay to start or expand your business and budget accordingly.'
Insurance: Run your business smart by insuring your employees' health, business amenities, etc., against unforeseen disasters.
Inventory: Analyse your inventory and make proper plans to invest more if it doesn't meet future expectations.
Running advertisements and website maintenance: To make a profit, you need to be seen, and an effective way to do so is to run paid social media ads and have an operational website. Make the right budget and fund accordingly.
Rent, Equipment, and Utilities: If you're operating a brick-and-mortar business, you'll need to budget for the rent, machinery, and other equipment to run efficiently. Ensure you properly understand the commercial lease or rent terms before signing a contract. 
Types of Business Funding
There are two types of funding options you can seek out for your business they include;
1. Zero-debt financing: Here, you invest in your business through your savings or investments from people, which you receive in exchange for non-monetary incentives such as equity. 
This type of funding is advisable if you are just starting out a new business idea and you wish to avoid taking debts you might not be able to handle.
2. Debt-financing: Here, you take a monetary loan with a promise to pay it back with interest. It is usually advisable to have a clear business plan that comprises competitor analysis, market research, financial projections, and revenue generation.
6 Ways to Get Funding for Your Business
1. Personal Financing or Bootstrapping
Funding: Zero-debt financing
When starting a business, this option is usually the first step many business owners take, as this allows them to avoid external debt. Here, you can fund your business with your funds or savings until your business becomes profitable. 
An advantage of this option is that you can avoid frequent debt financing and stay safe should the business hit some hurdles. Ultimately, this option is ideal for small businesses just kicking off; however, if you wish to expand, you should consider taking on external loans. 
2. Friends and Family
Funding: Zero-debt financing
Did you know that more businesses get funding by borrowing money from family and friends than from traditional banks? Most startup businesses use this funding approach. However, it is better to do it with transparency and accountability. 
When asking friends and family for funding support, ensure you are honest about your goals, vision, and financial projections. While Unlcle Bolaji might want to throw in a couple of nairas, it's essential that you treat each friend and family member like an external investor with a certain level of professionalism. 
In order to avoid creating rifts in relations in the future, ensure that you come to a formal agreement on what type of funding they are giving you. Is it a repayable loan, an investment, or some good-wish cash? Clearly outline the contract and use the money wisely.
3. Equity Financing, such as Venture Capital and Angel investment
Funding: Zero-debt financing
The two most common equity financing methods are venture capital and angel investing. In this case, you give individuals or firms an ownership share in your business in return for the capital they offer. 
Let's break it down a bit - Angel investing is easier for upcoming entrepreneurs as the angel investors are usually rich individuals or firms who tend to focus more on smaller investments. 
Alternatively, venture capital firms look to invest in fast-rising startups with a high potential to be lucrative businesses. Venture capitalists are mostly attracted to technology-driven sectors like communications, biotechnology, or information technology. 
Overall, no matter the type of investment option you choose, ensure that you properly spell out the conditions to avoid misunderstandings in the future. 
4. Business Loans
Funding: Debt-financing
Most small businesses or startup ventures find receiving loans from traditional financial institutions such as commercial banks difficult. This is where loans from micro-finance banks such as Moniepoint MFB come in. 
At Moniepoint, we gain insight into the financial history of businesses that use our services. This, along with a credit assessment system explicitly built for informal businesses, means you can access credit in a way that matches your needs. 
5. Government Grants
Funding: Zero-debt financing
The Government, through bodies like the Small and Medium Enterprises Development Agency of Nigeria (SMEDAN), offers various types of non-repayable business grants. They often do this for market expansion, development, research, or environmental purposes. 
To qualify for a government grant as a business owner, you'll have to submit a business plan, application forms as required, owners' background experience, and lots more. 
While it is a free and easily accessible opportunity for funding your business, you'll have to be patient as the timeline for application is broad to accommodate other business entries.
6. Crowdfunding
As a business owner who has gathered a dedicated audience and wishes to expand to a larger workspace or invest in more inventories, you can consider crowdfunding. 
This option involves a large number of people, each raising a small amount of money to support a particular individual or business goal. The common types of crowdfunding include;
Equity crowdfunding: Here, your donors will receive equity in your business as they anticipate future returns. 
Rewards-based crowdfunding: In this instance, your supporters donate money to your business in exchange for a non-financial reward. Such rewards can be exclusive access to events and first-user access to your product. 
Debt-based crowdfunding: In this case, supporters give you a loan, which you will pay back on a spelt-out schedule with interest.
Crowdfunding platforms are a good opportunity for small business owners to raise significant amounts of funds; however, you need to do your market research and have a compelling pitch.

How to Choose the Best Bank for Your Small Business
byChidinma Nwonye
As a small business owner, Ade has to make choices every day that impact the overall well-being of his venture. Each decision revolves around picking the right location, hoping for profitable sales, and aiming for the right amount of human traffic. 
As important as these are, it is vital that he chooses the right bank that offers him the services and support he needs to grow and maintain a smooth cash flow. 
If, like Ade, you're a business owner wondering how to choose the best bank for your small business, you're in the right place.
Let's consider the various tips, services, and offers when choosing a business bank account.
8 Tips to Consider When Choosing A Bank For Your Small Business
1. What are your Banking Needs?
Before choosing a bank for your business needs, ask yourself where you are currently and where you are headed. 
Outline your major needs: Do you need a business loan, a business current or checking account, digital or online banking services, etc? Knowing your business needs will enable you to make the right decision that will boost your growth in the long run.
2. What’s The Quality of Customer Support?
As your business grows, you'd want a bank that's there with you every step of the way. Another tip to consider is the quality of their customer service. You can ask yourself the following questions;
Is there a one-on-one relationship manager?
Is there round-the-clock support?
How soon does the service team respond to inquiries?
What are the bank's operational hours?
As a small business owner, you might need advice and guidance when making certain financial decisions, such as those concerning taxation, banking policies, and more. You can look out for reviews from other business owners and choose a bank with reliable and accessible customer service. 
3. What are the Bank's Service Fees?
Every bank has unique service fees that cut across individual transactions, overdrafts, etc. When choosing a bank for your business needs, ensure you do your due diligence and compare the various fees among banks. 
For instance, if your business frequently uses ATMs or debit cards, you should go for a bank that doesn't charge on the high side for those services. Some common fees banks charge include;
Service fees
Management fees
Account fees
ATM fees
Inactive account fees
Deposit and withdrawal fees
Card processing fees
One major goal in running a business is cost-effectiveness; therefore, choose a bank that helps you save money.
4. Digital and Online Banking Services
In our fast-paced world, nothing beats staying on top of your business accounts online, no matter where you are. A lot of banks now offer digital banking services that enable you to initiate transactions, check your balances, pay employees, and pay bills from your mobile device. 
For your improved business convenience, choose a bank with a user-friendly mobile app and digital platform. By utilizing the bank's digital features, you should be able to properly manage your business account and track your cash flow easily.
5. Tight Security and Fraud Protection
It's essential to choose a bank with tested and trusted security features. Look for advanced security features on the bank's platforms, such as two- or multi-factor authentication, real-time notifications, encryption, biometrics, and so on. You should be able to run your business and handle its financial flow with peace of mind. 
6. Incentives or Perks Offered by the Bank
A good business bank should typically offer a wide range of basic business banking services such as mobile banking, cash management services, debit cards, etc. You should, however, look for banks that go the extra mile to provide business owners with incentives that help boost their productivity. 
Some of these perks can include low-interest savings accounts, business banking dashboards, free consultation services, and lots more. Ensure you properly analyze these perks and know the cost attached to any of them before making a decision.
7. Easy Access to Credit and Loan Facilities
As your business grows, you might be exploring rooms for expansion; to do this, you'll require capital. A good business bank should offer you hassle-free access to taking approved loans. 
Banks like Moniepoint MFB gain insight into the financial history of businesses that use our services. This, along with a credit assessment system built specifically for informal businesses, means you can access credit in a way that matches your needs. 
8. Convenience

You can choose from a range of online banking services, or if you prefer a traditional bank service, ensure that its physical branch is close to your location.

What's the point of a core banking application?
byEmmanuel Paul
It’s the early 2000s, and I’m by my dad’s side as he fills out his bank book. Back then, he had to travel far just to use the same bank branch where he made his first deposit. Banks were not yet linked, and though I didn’t get it at the time, this showed a much bigger flaw that core banking would fix.
Now jump to 2020, when Moniepoint did what most fintechs wouldn’t do—build their own core banking system from the ground up. This system now handles billions of transactions daily, with a level of trust you don’t find often. But why does this matter to you? Most folks don’t care how core banking works. They just want their money to be safe and easy to reach.
To learn more about core banking and how Moniepoint’s system came to be, I spoke with Caleb, a Technical Program Manager (TPM), and Sulaiman, an enterprise architect. They played key roles in building a platform that could not only meet today's needs but also grow to handle what’s to come. Their insights gave me a glimpse into the care and hard work that went into ensuring Moniepoint’s system stays fast, safe, and scalable at every stage. 
In this edition of What’s the Point, we find out what exactly core banking is, how it affects your banking experience. 
What is core banking?
To understand a core banking application, we first need to understand the idea behind core banking itself.
Up until the early 2000s in Nigeria, banks were isolated. Each branch functioned as its own entity, meaning you couldn’t simply walk into a different branch of the same bank and access your account. Core banking changed that by making all branches work together as one.
Core banking is like the central nervous system of the human body. Just as the nervous system controls everything your body does—from moving muscles to sensing pain—core banking controls every financial action a bank performs, from updating account balances to processing loan applications. This system processes every deposit, transfer, withdrawal, or loan you initiate, and just like a nervous system, it operates silently in the background, ensuring everything functions smoothly.
The software that powers this essential functionality is called a core banking application (CBA). Think of it as a digital ledger. It is the backbone of a bank’s daily operations, managing everything from customer records to the seamless movement of funds across accounts. Without it, the bank’s day-to-day services would collapse, much like the human body would if the nervous system failed.
Let’s skim through what the CBA handles  behind the scenes: 
Customer Information: Holds all customer details, from personal information to account types like savings or loans.
Financial Records: Keeps track of every money that comes in and out of the bank, recording every transaction and updating things like assets and expenses when you make a deposit or withdrawal.
Customised Account Types: Configures different account options (think accounts with different transaction limits or interest rates), and sets up loan products with varying terms.
Daily Operations and Reporting: Manages everyday tasks (like teller activities and staff access) and provides reports on customer activity, loans, and transactions to keep everything running smoothly.
Why would a bank want to migrate from one CBA to the other?
Now that we’ve established what a CBA does and how crucial it is to our banking experience, why would a bank decide to change its CBA? Banks don’t decide to migrate their core banking applications (CBAs) on a whim. A migration typically comes with significant motivations, including cost, scalability, and the need to innovate. 
Let’s try to get costs out of the way. For banks using foreign CBAs, fluctuating FX rates can drastically increase the cost of maintenance, making foreign systems financially unsustainable over time. Since 2023, the cost of foreign software systems for most Nigerian businesses has increased, and you either source for local alternatives, build yours in-house or stop using the service altogether. 
Now, when companies are not worried about costs, growth and scalability are often a more pressing concern. Financial services companies anticipate growth in the number of accounts and transactions, and they need a system that can accommodate this while being able to add new features. 
Migrating to a new CBA can also allow banks to deploy new, modern features that old systems can’t support. Older CBAs often restrict banks from rolling out fresh digital experiences or adapting quickly. Financial institutions are innovating every day, and the core banking software needs to accommodate that.
The challenges of migration: Handling data and downtime
Migrating core banking data is a complex task. Banks need to create backup systems, plan phased data transfers, and thoroughly test everything to avoid disruptions. During migration, they often set up a parallel environment to simulate real transaction volumes and ensure all customer records, transaction histories, and regulatory data are safely transferred in steps.
You don’t want instances where the wrong accounts are credited, or duplicate transactions occur. If there are duplicate accounts, the system must be able to check if the customer is the same or different to prevent any confusion. Even minor errors can cause significant issues, affecting balances and records across thousands of accounts.
One big challenge is timing the final switch-over—the moment when banks go live on the new system. This usually happens during off-peak hours, like late at night, to minimise customer impact. But despite careful planning, unexpected issues can still pop up, causing delays. That’s why detailed preparation and rigorous testing are crucial to ensure customers can access their accounts smoothly and without disruptions.


How Moniepoint’s CBA was built for massive scale
In  2020, one year after we launched agency banking, more and more people were using Moniepoint, and we needed to move from using a simple database table. 
When we decided to switch to a core banking solution, we learned that off-the-shelf solutions, and open source weren’t enough for our growing needs. We needed a system that could accurately handle transaction records and the scale and demands of modern digital banking. 
You can read more about how we handled the magic in this article. All caught up? Good. Now, how did we approach reliability and scalability for the billions of transactions we pull today? Well, spoiler alert: no one in that team imagined what our numbers would look like 10 months after building, much less what they are today. 
Our approach to building a strong, fast system was clear: think ahead and plan for growth while also solving today's needs with proper maintenance and updates. We knew the system had to scale and be ready for what was coming.
To start, we used tools we knew well, like MySQL and Java Spring, so we could move fast. 
We didn’t just build for 2020; we looked ahead to how much traffic would grow. We ran tests with future numbers in mind to see how the system would cope, and made adjustments where necessary. Again, our actual numbers exploded in a surprisingly short time, so we had to get creative. We moved to more complex technologies that could support the exponential growth we were looking at. 
We also built in backup plans. If the system failed, we had ways to get back up fast. We made backups before going live and built a system that lets us move things around without stopping transactions. Before any big move, we cloned the system to test for issues. For example, when we saw a three-hour move that needed to be faster, we fixed it to take just two hours, doing it at night when fewer users were online.
Now, remember, core banking services don’t work alone. They work with diverse services, and we had to plan for when some services fail. We built a way to send traffic to other providers if one went down, and our users wouldn’t even know what was happening. 
We hope this article helps you understand core banking at a high level. At Moniepoint, it’s simply a software ledger that helps you bank without stress. 

Now, if you’d love us to get a bit more technical on issues we solved when building, please let us know. If you’d love to see things for yourself, we saved a spot for you on our careers page.

Monitoring and Observability of Distributed, High-Traffic Systems
byDumebi Duru
You've probably come across the saying, 'You can’t manage what you can’t measure'. A popular mantra in the business world, it underscores the importance of data for effective running and continuous improvement of business operations. Without keeping track of key metrics, it's hard to know what to improve or if you're making any progress towards your goals.
In software engineering, monitoring and observability play a similar role, allowing us to gather essential data about a system's performance, health, and behavior so that we can guarantee reliability while improving our operations.
Modern software systems are expected to handle thousands, sometimes millions of user requests per day with minimal downtime. Achieving this level of reliability requires deep visibility into system performance so we can proactively detect issues, pinpoint bottlenecks, and leverage data-driven insights to optimize our operations.
In this note, we’ll take a close look at monitoring and observability—exploring the key components, tools, implementation strategies, and best practices.
Understanding the Basics
Monitoring focuses on detection and proactive issue management, while observability provides deeper insights into the root causes and mechanisms behind those issues. Both concepts are grounded in Control Theory, which uses feedback to steer systems toward desired outcomes. Let’s clarify both terms:
Monitoring involves collecting, analyzing, visualizing, and using data to track the performance and health of systems and infrastructure. It is a systematic and ongoing process for detecting issues and maintaining smooth operations.
Observability refers to how well we can understand a system’s internal state based on its external outputs. It takes a broader, more proactive approach than traditional monitoring, emphasizing the ability to diagnose and comprehend complex system behaviors.
Monitoring and observability work hand in hand—monitoring provides the essential foundation, while observability helps uncover deeper insights to understand and resolve issues more effectively.
The Importance of Monitoring and Observability
Let's take a moment to appreciate why these two concepts are relevant:
Enhanced System Reliability
Due to proactive issue detection, we are in a better position to recognize issues before they occur or escalate. This allows us to maintain reliable systems that serve user requests. We also enjoy reduced downtime, because we're more proactive than reactive.
Faster Incident Response
We can quickly identify bottlenecks in our system as well as areas of fault. This allows us to drill down quickly to the root cause of problems and render quick diagnoses because our troubleshooting is much more efficient.
Improved Performance Optimization
Because we have better visibility into the system, we can tune and optimize our system's performance to achieve the best results. We can also tell when resources are under-utilized; this allows us to make improvements to our architecture to drive better utilization of resources for optimal results.
Better User Experience
At the end of the day, we engineer systems to serve user requests. When systems are more reliable, this translates to better service availability and overall user experience. Engineering is such an integral part of product execution; more often than not, engineering reliable systems translates to a happy customer experience.
Informed Decision Making
An added benefit of observability is we are now in a position to make informed architectural decisions with data-driven insights. We can also observe and analyze trends in our system usage.


Key Components of Observability
Now that we have convinced ourselves of the relevance of monitoring and observability, the next question is what are the key components to address when we embark on this journey:
Metrics
Traces
Logs
Events
Let's look at them one by one.

Metrics
Metrics provide quantitative insights into performance and health. They are numerical data points that represent specific aspects of a system's performance over time. Metrics are typically collected as time-series data that can be aggregated over a period. There are different types of Metrics:
System Metrics
CPU Usage: Percentage of CPU capacity being utilized.
Memory Consumption: Amount of RAM being used by processes or services.
Disk I/O: Read and write operations per second.
Network Throughput: Data transfer rates over network interfaces.
Application Metrics
Request Rate (Throughput): Number of requests handled per unit of time.
Error Rate: Percentage of failed requests or operations.
Latency: Time taken to process a request or operation.
Concurrency: Number of simultaneous operations or users.
Business Metrics
Transaction Volume: Number of transactions processed.
Revenue per User: Average revenue generated per user.
Conversion Rates: Percentage of users completing desired actions.
Each of these metrics delivers key insights into the performance, behavior, and overall health of our system. This helps us make data-driven decisions in our engineering. For example, if we have persistent high CPU usage, we can tell that our system is maxing out on CPU and we need to optimize our operations to use less CPU or perhaps we need to scale our compute.

Traces
A trace is the end-to-end journey of a request as it travels through various services and components within a system. A trace tells a story of how a request was processed from start to finish. Typically, a trace consists of multiple spans.
A span is a unit of work within a trace that has a definite start and end.
Traces allow us to identify bottlenecks and let us know where a request spent the most time in its processing.
Let's look at a scenario where a user makes a request to an e-commerce website to purchase an item.
The trace represents the entire purchase process from the user's initial request to the final confirmation.
We can identify a few spans in the trace:
User Service: Receives the purchase request.
Inventory Service: Checks item availability.
Payment Service: Processes the payment.
Notification Service: Sends a confirmation email to the user.
Each of these operations is a span within the overarching trace of the purchase request. A trace might tell us that we spent most of the time in Payment Service because processing payment takes the longest time while servicing the request.

Logs
Logs provide a record of events, actions, or important information that enables developers to diagnose issues. They are timestamped documentation of facts that give us visibility into what is happening in our system.
There are different types of Logs:
Application Logs:
Generated by applications to record operational events, such as user actions, business transactions, and application-specific messages.
System Logs:
Produced by the operating system to document system-level events, including hardware changes, system errors, and security events.
Security Logs:
Capture security-related events like authentication attempts, access control violations, and intrusion detection alerts.
Audit Logs:
Maintain a record of system and user activities for compliance and auditing purposes, ensuring traceability of actions.
Event Logs:
General logs that record significant events within the system, which may include both informational and error messages.
Log types can have different levels of severity. Severity allows us to categorize logs according to their relevance or the amount of attention they require. FATAL, ERROR, TRACE, DEBUG, and INFO are some examples of log levels that applications can use to categorize logs according to their severity. With this, developers can filter for specific log levels in the course of their inquiry into system behavior.


Events
Events are discrete occurrences of interest within a system. They help us identify when something of interest has happened in the system. Events are usually timestamped, providing contextual information (metadata) that helps understand the event.
There are different types of events:
System-level Events:
System boot, shutdown, service restarts, hardware failures.
Application level Events:
User logins, data processing completions, feature toggles, and configuration changes.
Security level Events:
Authentication attempts, access control changes, and intrusion detection alerts.
Operational Events:
Deployment of new code, scaling of services, and scheduled maintenance.
Business Events:
Transaction completions, order placements, subscription renewals.
Performance Events:
Spike in response times, resource utilization thresholds being crossed.
Events can be collected in different ways: via logs, dedicated event streams, or code instrumentation.

Implementing Monitoring and Observability
This section of the note covers the process for implementing effective monitoring and observability in your system. With the advent of microservices and distributed systems, software systems have become more complex. Amidst the complexity, we must ensure reliability and operational efficiency. Let's dive into some of the key elements of an effective monitoring and observability strategy.
Set Up Metrics Collection
One of the first things you want to do is identify the key metrics to collect. Remember, earlier in this note we touched on System Metrics, Application Metrics, and Business Metrics. You will need to identify the metrics that are relevant to your context. The next question is: how do you identify the relevant metrics?
Understand your Business and Technical Goals. What is important to you on a technical level? Is uptime critical to your business? Optimize for the ability to improve performance, troubleshoot, plan, and guarantee the security and stability of your system.
Identify Critical components. Which components are most essential for delivering value and need closer monitoring?
What KPIs are relevant to you? response times, throughput, latency, resource utilization (CPU, memory, disk I/O), uptime, error rates, mean time between failures (MTBF), page load times, user satisfaction scores, and number of unauthorized access attempts. These are a few KPIs that can give you a comprehensive pulse of your entire system.
Prioritize actionable metrics. Pay more attention to metrics that can lead to specific actions and avoid metrics that don't provide clear value. This will help increase our Signal-to-Noise ratio.
Use standard libraries and tools - much better than building your own tools from scratch.
Adopt Effective Logging Strategies
Implement structured logging with appropriate log levels to ensure that logs are informative and manageable.
Common Log Levels:
DEBUG: Detailed information for diagnosing issues during development.
INFO: General operational information about the application's normal behavior.
WARN: Indicators of potential issues that do not currently affect functionality.
ERROR: Errors that affect functionality and require immediate attention.
FATAL: Severe errors that lead to application termination.
Avoid Logging Sensitive Information. This includes passwords and personal information. You can also use masks to hide sensitive data.
Use descriptive messages that will aid in quickly identifying issues.
Handle logs securely. Encrypt logs in transit and at rest to protect against unauthorized access.
Monitor Log Health, to be sure you're not missing logs and the logging infrastructure is functioning correctly.
Manage Log Storage by using strategies like Log Rotation. This will help prevent exhaustion of storage. You might also want to avoid logging at a very verbose level unless you're debugging and need verbosity.
If you're using a Cloud Provider, in many cases you won't have to bother too much about implementing the above strategies yourself. However, Cloud Providers provide a foundation and oftentimes require you to tweak or customize the defaults to suit your needs. Hence it pays to have a good grasp of how to imbibe effective logging strategies.
Implement Distributed Tracing
Especially if you have requests that span multiple services. It helps to be able to trace the entire life cycle of a request even across service boundaries. This is where we do Trace Context Propagation - passing trace identifiers across service boundaries to maintain the continuity of the request journey.
As much as possible, you should automate this context propagation, so the logic is not liable to errors in implementation. Leverage existing libraries or frameworks.
Use Sampling Techniques to manage the volume of trace data. This can serve storage costs or performance concerns. In very high-traffic systems, the volume of trace data can be very high. Sampling makes a tracing system scalable and manageable.
Be sure you have a tool or dashboard that allows you to visualize traces. Visualizing helps to quickly grasp information and make decisions.
Setup Automated Alerts
Pay attention to critical metrics like CPU or RAM usage. It is important to set up automated alerts to warn when thresholds are exceeded. You can also use machine learning algorithms to identify unusual patterns or anomalies.
Alerts should be dispatched to the parties responsible for the reported issue. Ensure you have clearly defined protocols for escalating and resolving different alert types. This will make the process smoother.
Automated alerts enable reduced issue response time and quick resolution.
Manage monitoring configuration with code that flows through CI.
How to Choose the Right Stack
A good approach will be to consider what is important to you. Understand your Business and Technical Goals.
You can also experiment with different tools and set up tests to get a feel of how the tools work. Ease of use, Reliability, and Scalability are some of the primary concerns to keep at the back of your mind when making your choices. The technology stack should be able to scale with the business.
Foster a Culture of Observability
When setting up observability, you reap the best results when your teams do not work in silos. In essence, there should be knowledge sharing across teams. Synchronization of efforts and sharing of infrastructure and tooling. This creates a collaborative mindset, one that will yield greater results for the organization.
And while at it, practice continuous improvement. Regularly review processes and systems for optimizations and improvements. Adapt your observability as the system's architecture evolves.


Future Trends in Monitoring and Observability
AI and Machine Learning are revolutionizing software development and this applies to monitoring and observability. Using AI, we can achieve more intelligent and proactive monitoring systems.
Predictive analytics involves using statistical inference on historical data to forecast future events. This means anticipating potential system failures, performance degradation, or security breaches.
Another use for ML is Automated anomaly detection which helps to quickly detect and respond to deviations from regular system behaviour.
OpenTelemetry as an industry standard provides a unified set of APIs, SDKs, and tools for instrumenting applications, making it easier to collect and export telemetry data consistently across different platforms and services. Telemetry data comprises metrics, traces, and logs.
OpenTelemetry data format is standard and interoperable, facilitating integration with diverse monitoring tools. This encourages collaboration and community development.
You can learn more about OpenTelemetry on this link .
Greater Emphasis on User Experience Monitoring
As applications become more user-centric, monitoring and observability practices are increasingly focusing on the end-user experience. Understanding how users interact with applications provides valuable insights for improving product quality.
This creates a feedback loop where the insights we get from user interaction data are incorporated into the development of the product.



Conclusion
This note turned out to be more extensive than I initially anticipated. As we delve deeper into monitoring and observability, it becomes increasingly clear just how vital these concepts are in software development. We cannot fully optimize what we cannot measure, and to optimise our performance and reliability, we must implement effective observability practices. By equipping ourselves with the right tools and adopting a robust observability philosophy, we can ensure the reliability of our systems and ultimately create experiences that delight our end users.
In my next note on this topic, I will take a hands-on approach by setting up a comprehensive monitoring and observability stack for a Rust application using Jaeger, Prometheus, and Grafana. This practical application will help solidify our understanding.

What’s the point of the Electronic Money Transfer Levy (EMTL)?
byEmmanuel Paul
So you just saw a push notification or an email about a ₦50 charge on transfers above ₦10,000, and you’re wondering, what’s going on? Don’t worry, we’ve got you covered. 
The Electronic Money Transfer Levy (EMTL) is a government-mandated fee for electronic transfers in Nigeria. We understand that this might be confusing, and we’re here to explain. In this article, we’ll make sense of the levy, why it’s necessary, and how Moniepoint is ensuring a smooth transition while keeping your transactions secure and reliable. 
What is the Electronic Money Transfer Levy (EMTL)?
The Electronic Money Transfer Levy (EMTL) is a ₦50 charge applied to electronic transfers of ₦10,000 and above in Nigeria. It was first introduced through the Finance Act 2019, which expanded the scope of dutiable instruments under the Stamp Duties Act (SDA) to include electronic transactions. The levy officially took effect in 2020, following its formal introduction through the Finance Act 2020, which renamed the charge as EMTL. The EMTL Regulations of 2022 solidified the regulation to streamline its administration and collection.
Key Changes in EMTL History:
	•	2019: The Finance Act introduced amendments to the SDA, setting the groundwork for the EMTL.
	•	2020: The Finance Act established the levy as a one-off ₦50 charge on qualifying electronic transactions.
	•	2021: Further amendments gave the Minister of Finance oversight of the levy’s administration.
	•	2023: The latest amendment revised the revenue-sharing formula, allocating 15% to the Federal Government, 50% to State Governments, and 35% to Local Governments.
How the Money Flows:
	1.	Transaction Initiated: When a transfer of ₦10,000 or more is made, the receiving bank deducts ₦50.
	2.	Levy Remittance: The bank remits the levy to the Federal Inland Revenue Service (FIRS) by the next working day.
	3.	Government Distribution: Collected levies are distributed according to the Finance Act’s latest formula.
Why does the government need the EMTL?
Taxes keep the lights on in many countries. They fund the things we all rely on daily: public hospitals, schools, roads, and services that form the backbone of society. Without taxes, none of these would exist. In Nigeria, where more and more people are moving towards digital transactions, the way the government collects revenue also has to adapt. That’s where the Electronic Money Transfer Levy (EMTL) comes in.
With the digital economy booming, traditional tax methods like stamp duties on paper-based transactions no longer cut it. The EMTL ensures the government can still collect the funds it needs, even in this new digital age. This levy taps into the millions of daily electronic transactions, ensuring the government doesn’t miss out on revenue as the economy goes digital. The government uses this money to fund critical services and infrastructure required to run the nation, like schools, hospitals, roads, and public transport. 
It’s not just a Nigerian thing.
So, you might be thinking, 'Is this just a Nigeria thing?' Actually, no. Globally, countries seek ways to capture value from digital financial transactions. Take Kenya, for instance—if you’ve heard of M-Pesa, you know everyone and their uncle uses it to pay for everything. Over there, people pay a tax on mobile money transactions. Same thing in Uganda, where there’s a levy on mobile money withdrawals.
India? They’ve rolled out fees on certain digital payments, too, and even countries like Australia and parts of the European Union are considering digital transaction taxes to ensure that online businesses and platforms contribute their fair share.
As more of us go cashless, their tax systems must follow suit. It’s about fairness. 
Why fintechs must comply - and why fintechs complying benefits you.
Let’s be real—if you’re a fintech like Moniepoint, compliance with regulations is a no-brainer. The government has set out clear rules: if you handle electronic transactions, you must apply the levy. Complying with this helps establish trust and credibility; failure to do so comes with serious consequences. 
Fintechs that don’t comply risk fines and penalties, including a 150% penalty of the levy not collected, plus interest. Simply put, for every ₦50 a fintech doesn’t collect, it would be fined ₦125. Worse still, failure to remit the levy to the Federal Inland Revenue Service (FIRS) could lead to further penalties that could even affect a company’s operational licence.
But this goes beyond avoiding fines. Compliance is about trust. Customers need to know that their fintech provider operates within the law, ensuring their transactions are secure and above board.
When fintechs like Moniepoint adhere to these standards, they reinforce their commitment to transparency and trustworthiness, which directly benefits you.
Enhanced Security: Compliance requires fintechs to maintain rigorous security standards, safeguarding your data and transactions from fraud. You can rest assured that your money transfers are fast and protected by industry-leading security measures.
Trust and Reliability: Knowing that your fintech provider complies with national regulations helps build trust. Moniepoint’s adherence to the EMTL means you’re banking with a provider that respects the law and ensures your transactions are valid, secure, and recognised by regulatory bodies.
Stable Financial Services: By fulfilling its obligations to the government, Moniepoint can focus on delivering innovative services without the risk of fines or operational disruptions. This stability means uninterrupted service for you, with the promise of continuous improvements and new features that can enhance your experience.
If you’re interested in building regulation-compliant financial products for millions of Africans, join us! We've got a spot for you.

Moniepoint gives STEM education a big boost as OAU commissions Tosin Eniolorunda Design lab 
byBemigho Awala
In a move aimed at advancing STEM education and fostering technological innovation in Nigeria, the Mechanical Engineering Department of Obafemi Awolowo University (OAU), Ile-Ife received a substantial investment as the Tosin Eniolorunda Computer-Aided Design (CAD) and Computer-Aided Manufacturing (CAM) laboratory was unveiled at the University’s campus. The gesture which is in alignment with Moniepoint’s corporate social responsibility ethos is designed to significantly contribute to efforts aimed at bolstering Nigeria’s foundation in the very important area of science and technology while making subjects such as prototyping, design and engineering in general easier, participatory and enjoyable for students. 
With the recent rise in the global tech industry, stakeholders aver that investment in STEM education will drive the socio-economic development of Africa and Nigeria, particularly. However, with a burgeoning population where over 60% of Africa’s population is still under 25, a recent survey shows that less than 25% of African students in secondary and tertiary institutions pursue STEM-related career fields. 
At a ceremony to commission the facility, the Vice-Chancellor, Professor Adebayo Bamire, expressed his profound gratitude over the philanthropic donation by Moniepoint and Tosin Eniolorunda, co-founder of Moniepoint, who’s an alumnus of OAU's Mechanical Engineering Department. He noted that many tertiary institutions across the country suffered from paucity of funds, which in turn has led to infrastructural challenges, while encouraging other alumni to not only emulate this culture of giving back but also join hands to support worthy causes within the university.
'We are really very grateful for this laboratory considering that we are almost phasing out some of these things as a result of paucity of funds. This has to do with the yearnings which will also improve the livelihoods of our people, especially the students. So when we have an organisation that has come in to meet our needs, we can only say thank you. This laboratory will help improve and enhance a lot of things within the University for students and staff and also drive collaboration between the academia and industry,' he said.  
Tosin Eniolorunda, commenting on the donation, stated, 'this newly revamped lab represents more than just an upgrade, it stands as part of a personal commitment to foster a generation of engineers and innovators who are not only skilled, but also inspired to think critically and creatively about real-world problems. A catalyst for innovation for the next generation of engineers and technologists who will drive Nigeria's economic growth and advancement. By investing in STEM education and providing access to platforms like this lab, we're laying the critical rails for the emergence of leaders, innovators, and changemakers that Nigeria needs.'
Furthermore, he thanked the University community for its continued dedication to the pursuit of knowledge and innovation in learning and culture, adding that the future of engineering and technology in Nigeria is bright because of the young talents within the ivory tower.
The upgrade includes renovation of the existing laboratory space with cutting-edge facilities that include the provision of high-performance desktop computers and laptops, electronic board for interactive learning, laboratory furniture, supply and installation of sustainable power solutions and advanced cooling systems.  These state-of-the-art resources will provide students with hands-on experience in the latest CAD/CAM technologies, bridging the gap between theoretical knowledge and practical application in the field of mechanical engineering.
Dean, Faculty of Technology, Prof. Lasisi Umoru noted that the revamped facility will increase research capabilities and output in CAD/CAM technologies, improve graduates' employability in the global job market, and serve as a model for STEM education facilities across Nigeria.
The commissioning ceremony which attracted dignitaries from within and outside the University included Deputy Vice-Chancellor, Academics, Prof. M. Babalola, DVC, Administration - Prof. Adaramola, DVC Research, Innovation and Development, Prof. Akinyemi, Chairman, Committee of  Deans, Prof Adesina, Chairman, Ceremonials Committee, Prof Adekola, Head of Department, Mechanical Engineering, Prof. Obayopo, Retired Prof of Mechanical Engineering, Prof. Adekoya, Chairman Nigerian Institute of Public Relations, Osun state chapter, Ademola Adesoji and Special Assistant to the Osun state governor on ICT, Sola Isola, Oyinlola Eniolorunda and Israel Eniolorunda as well as Head of Partnerships, Moniepoint Inc, Efemena Ogie, Employee Branding Lead, Gbemi Adekanmbi amongst others.

A quick hello from Moniepoint's VP of Corporate Finance
byOmondi Ochieng
Hello! It isn’t every day that you get a nostalgic feeling when you come across a new company. Growing up in Kenya, surrounded by M-Pesa and its impact, I got a sense of familiarity when I came across Moniepoint. I just knew I had to be a part of what they were building.
I started my career in the audit and assurance industry, focusing on financial services clients. Subsequently, I spent time with early-stage start-ups in aquaculture and fintech before a short stint working with a VC firm. While at the VC firm, I worked on the Moniepoint Series A and Series B transactions, and when the fundraiser closed, I made the switch to join Moniepoint! 
Here’s a mini-documentary of my life and professional journey. 
Life Growing Up
I was born and raised on a farm in Kenya.  Growing up, my parents worked hard to provide for us and made incredible sacrifices to send us to the best schools in the country, even though it was a big stretch for them. 
After high school, I pursued a degree in actuarial science, intending to become an actuary—a decision that would mark the beginning of my professional journey.
Adulting 101
After university, I had my eyes fixed on the actuarial industry, but as fate would have it, I found myself at Deloitte, where I trained as a CPA. Over six years with them, I lived and worked in multiple countries, including Kenya, Ethiopia, the US, and the UK.
After six years, I itched for something different and also wanted to be back home in Kenya, where there was a wave of new start-ups coming up. I reached out to a founder of a greenfield aquaculture start-up who agreed to let me join him. I took the leap of faith, left the UK, and returned to Kenya. The farm was located next to the shores of Lake Victoria and had the most beautiful sunsets. The work at the farm was challenging and rewarding, but I wanted to be in the technology space, which, with its fast pace and innovation, is more my style.
This led me to join Tala, one of the pioneer digital lending consumer start-ups, where I spent three years building out the finance function for their Kenyan business before taking a left-field move to join Novastar Ventures, a $200m venture capital firm investing in early-stage start-ups primarily in East and West Africa. While at Novastar Ventures, I worked on the Moniepoint (then TeamApt) Series A and Series B fundraises. It was one of the most exciting companies I had seen, and I could bet my life that it would be a blowout success given the parallels it had with some of the successful payment companies I had seen, such as M-Pesa. So when I was asked to join Moniepoint, it was an easy decision.
Joining Moniepoint
When I first encountered Moniepoint, I was struck by its similarity to M-Pesa in Kenya. The company’s focus at that time was on cash-in, cash-out transactions, a model that had seen great success with M-Pesa in driving financial inclusion. I could see the potential Moniepoint had to grow, ride the payments digitisation curve and make a significant impact.
However, it wasn’t just the business model that drew me in. It was Tosin, Moniepoint’s CEO. Listening to him articulate his vision for the company, it was clear that Moniepoint wasn’t just a business—it was a mission. His passion and the scale of his dreams were captivating. It was hard to say no, and I quickly realised that Moniepoint had the potential to become something extraordinary.
The dream at that time, when it was being pitched to Novastar, was for Teamapt to revolutionise banking by creating an agency banking model that would allow customers to get all types of banking and payment services through a network of agents, i.e. a decentralised, low-cost,  technology-driven bank. 
Currently, digitisation has taken Moniepoint in a different direction. But ultimately, Moniepoint is still solving the same problems - enabling people to pay in a manner that is most convenient for them. 
My Day to Day
My role at Moniepoint has been multifaceted. I have worked on several areas across corporate finance, including supporting fundraising efforts, investor and board reporting, financial planning and analysis, and M&A deals to drive expansion.
One of the most exciting parts of my job is that I get to imagine and build new processes or systems and evolve them as the company scales to new heights. Seeing the tangible impact of my work and knowing that it’s contributing to the company’s success is incredibly fulfilling. I am also privileged by the opportunity my role provides to see, analyse and try to connect the various dots from the different pieces of all the great things happening across Moniepoint.
Jamaican in New York
I was the first Kenyan to join the Moniepoint team as a full-time employee. If you’re wondering how it felt to work with a predominantly Nigerian team as the only Kenyan, it honestly was a smooth transition for me. My previous roles had exposed me to diverse cultures, including working with Nigerians in the US, some of whom are still my good friends to date, so it didn’t feel too foreign.
In my first few weeks at Moniepoint, I quickly noticed how hardworking, passionate and ambitious everyone was. It was like being surrounded by a tribe of super-ambitious, driven individuals who were focused on getting things done. It’s a dynamic, fast-moving environment, and that’s precisely the kind of place where I thrive. I was truly home.
That’s not to say there were no cultural differences. The biggest difference is the communication style. Kenyans tend to be more subtle, while Nigerians are more direct. The message is often the same, but the delivery is different. I appreciate both styles, and they’ve helped me adapt to various situations within the company.
Looking to Join Moniepoint? 
If you’re considering joining Moniepoint, my advice is simple: stay in execution mode. Things move fast here, and you'll be surrounded by people who like to get things done.
Also, remember that no matter how tough things seem, they will always get better. Since I joined, the company has only grown stronger, and the future looks brighter every day. Tomorrow is always a better day than today.
So, if you’re ready to be part of something big, head over to our careers page now! We’d love to have you on the team.
Asante!

Moniepoint, others join forces to Empower Women and PLWDs with Financial Literacy and Cyber Hygiene Initiative
byBemigho Awala
In a move designed to enhance financial literacy and strengthen online business security for women entrepreneurs and People Living with Disabilities (PLWDs), Africa’s fastest growing financial institution according to the Financial Times, Moniepoint Inc in collaboration with ACIOE Associates and Tech4Dev recently hosted a two-day intensive workshop in Abuja. 
With over 100 participants, the initiative which targeted small and micro-enterprise owners, aimed to address the growing need for financial education and digital security in an increasingly online business environment with these business owners gaining valuable insights into financial planning, budgeting, cybersecurity, and safe online payment practices through a series of practical sessions and interactive activities. The workshop also placed special emphasis on advancing gender inclusion, highlighting the need for financial literacy and cyber hygiene as tools to empower vulnerable groups, particularly women.
According to organizers, the initiative is crucial in addressing the low levels of financial literacy that persist in many parts of the world, especially Nigeria, which can hinder economic growth and financial inclusion. Studies have shown that financial literacy is linked to improved access to basic financial services, formal savings, and overall economic development. The workshop’s organizers also maintained that improving women’s financial literacy will enable them to make informed decisions, access financial services, and build wealth, ultimately contributing to gender equality and economic empowerment. 
'Businesses are vital cogs in the wheels of economic growth, development and job creation. Financial literacy is key to achieving social and economic inclusion, particularly for women seeing that when women understand financial concepts, they are better equipped to manage their finances, access financial services, and build wealth. This in turn gives them the impetus to pursue their entrepreneurial aspirations and contribute more significantly to the economy,' said Tosin Eniolorunda, Group CEO, Moniepoint Inc. 
He added that 'against the backdrop of our recently launched Informal Economy Report, there is a need to provide a platform for ensuring that many businesses can survive and thrive beyond the five-year mark considering that eighty percent of businesses especially those in the informal sector have been operating for less than five years. Also, the link between financial literacy and financial inclusion has become an international policy concern, this is our own way of contributing to the conversation, powering the dreams of this vulnerable group and doing what needs to be done to support Nigeria’s socio-economic aspirations.'
Innocent Isichei, Managing Partner, ACIOE Associates, an advisory services firm providing a rich suite of solutions across various sectors noted that 'Businesswomen and PWLDs are especially vulnerable to online threats. By building a secure digital 'fortress,' women can confidently navigate the online environment, safeguard their businesses, and leverage technology for growth. Beyond online safety, achieving economic empowerment for women requires addressing significant financial literacy and access challenges.'
Furthermore he said that 'these challenges include limited financial knowledge, restricted access to credit, societal barriers, and gender-based discrimination within the financial sector. ACIOE Associates recognizes these critical needs and that's why we have partnered with Moniepoint and Tech4Dev to offer this comprehensive two-day workshop.'
Via a series of practical sessions, participants learned essential skills in budgeting, saving, and investment strategies tailored to small business needs. The program also covered vital cyber hygiene practices to protect businesses from data breaches, phishing scams, and malware attacks while learning how to leverage technology for business expansion while maintaining a secure online presence.
The participants lauded the organizers for their demonstrated commitment to supporting the economic empowerment of women and PLWDs, by equipping them with the skills needed to succeed in an increasingly digital and complex economy.

To the girls with the 'louding' dreams - a Moniepoint CSR initiative
byAderayo Adesokan
Powering dreams is at the core of Moniepoint’s ethos, driving everything we do for the millions of people who interact with our products across Africa. We believe that everyone deserves to see their dreams come true, no matter where they come from. This belief was the driving force behind our campaign for International Day of the girl child, where our team visited Hope for the Slum Child in Makoko, Lagos and the Ovie Brume Foundation.
We shared copies of 'The Girl with the Louding Voice,' a book by Abi Daré, with the girls at these initiatives. The story in this book reiterates an idea we hold dear—that girls can change their communities and the world when they’re given a voice. Every one of these girls has a dream and, like anyone else, deserves to see their dreams come true.
We had reading sessions with the girls where we discussed the story, and its importance and talked about their dreams as well. To them, the main character, Adunni serves as a symbol of just what is possible when they set their minds and hearts to it.
The school at Makoko, was established to provide free and quality education to children in the community. It was inspiring to everyone on our team, to see these children thriving, and embodying every dream that they had.
Speaking to the team at the Ovie Brume Foundation, they spotlighted how much the children understood, and learnt, from the characters in the book; ' A lot of them while reading the book, you could hear them say 'why would someone behave like this? Why would a man treat a child this way?' so it felt like the kids really understood this character, and they learn from that'.
Both of these places serve as key points in their communities, where the girl child can find hope for a better future and the realisation of their dreams. We were delighted to inspire these girls, and bring them a step closer to seeing those dreams come true.

Restricted Account: What is PND in Moniepoint?
byChidinma Nwonye
As a Moniepoint Personal and Business account holder, your account can be restricted and issued a PND. Although this can hinder your desired transfer, it's essential to pay attention to the reason it's issued and how to rectify it. 
Let's look at what a PND is in Moniepoint, the various reasons you might encounter one, and how to resolve them.
What is PND?
A PND or 'Post No Debit' is a restriction that prevents you from withdrawing or making debits from an account. Simply put, when a PND is placed on your account, you cannot transfer money, pay bills, or make any form of payment using that account. 
However, you can still receive deposits, meaning money can come in but can't go out. 
Getting a PND indicates that your account has triggered some fraudulent or compliance issues. 
Here are some of the reasons you might get a PND on your Moniepoint account;
1. Scheme Rule Violation
A violation of scheme rules is one of the most common reasons your account can get a PND restriction. Scheme rules are guidelines set by Moniepoint and regulatory bodies like the Central Bank of Nigeria. These rules govern the conduct of financial transactions, ensuring security and transparency. 
A breach of the scheme of rules can occur if your account is involved in any suspicious transaction that violates Moniepoint's policies. 
For instance, engaging in money laundering and not inputting your correct details in your KYC verifications, among others, can violate Moniepoint's scheme rules. Once these occur, a PND can be placed as a preventive measure for further investigation. 
If the account holder is found guilty of suspicious activity, their account gets suspended, but if proven innocent, they will need to provide adequate information to clear their names.
2. Stolen Phone or Terminal
Losing your phone or terminal could mean exposing your sensitive financial data to unauthorised individuals. In such cases, Moniepoint can issue a PND at your request to protect your funds from being tampered with by someone else.
It's essential to take this measure, as losing your mobile device can allow an authorised person to access your bank app and financial information. You can avoid this by reporting to Moniepoint, proving your ownership, and following the required security protocols to regain access to your account.
3. Fraudulent Inflow & Outflow of Funds
Another reason you can see a PND is suspicious or fraudulent fund inflows and outflows. This can occur when significant money suddenly enters or leaves your account without a clear, legitimate source or destination.
Fraudulent transactions are red flags for financial institutions like Moniepoint, and these unusual patterns can indicate money laundering, scams, or other illegal financial activities. If you believe the inflows or outflows are legitimate, it is important to contact your support officer with evidence of the transactions, such as invoices, receipts, or communication that validates the sources.
4. Restriction Placed by BRM Due to Terminal Issue or Target Issue
Sometimes, PND restrictions are enforced by the Branch Relationship Manager (BRM) due to technical issues with the terminal or specific target problems related to the account. 
This can occur when the system identifies inconsistencies or discrepancies that require immediate action. While this type of restriction is less common, it shows how even technical or system-based issues can cause a PND restriction. 
Ensure that you cooperate with Moniepoint's investigation team by submitting additional documentation to clarify and rectify the issue.
5. Erroneous Transaction
An erroneous transaction can easily trigger a PND restriction. This can happen when money is mistakenly credited or debited to/from your account due to a system malfunction or human error.
If we discover an error, our system may apply a PND until the funds are returned or verified. Rest assured that providing adequate documentation or clarification can speed up the resolution process.
6. Crypto Transactions
With the rise of cryptocurrency trading, Moniepoint has implemented stricter regulations, such as disallowing crypto transactions on user accounts. A PND may be placed if an account is linked to cryptocurrency activities.
Since cryptocurrency operates outside traditional banking frameworks, this can create legal and compliance headaches for financial institutions.
7. Regulatory Block
Regulatory authorities can sometimes restrict an account based on the account owner's profile. This is common when someone fails to comply with anti-money laundering laws, tax evasion investigations, or other regulatory frameworks.
A PND can also be applied here to prevent further financial misdeeds until they clear their name with the concerned authorities. To resolve it, account holders are advised to adhere strictly to the law, submit necessary documentation, and cooperate fully with investigative bodies.
8. Details Used to Create an Unauthorised Account
A PND may also occur if you create an account with incorrect or fraudulent information. Identity theft and impersonation are significant concerns in our digital world, and they often result in accounts being created with stolen or false information.
You can resolve this restriction by proving your identity, verifying your information with the bank, and potentially filing a report if you were a victim of identity theft.
9. Delayed Refund Due to Business Owner's Non-Compliance with the Refund Process
If you are due a refund but fail to comply with the refund process as an account holder, a PND may be placed until the situation is resolved. 
Financial institutions like banks have specific procedures for requesting refunds. Failure to meet requirements, such as providing insufficient details or not following the proper steps, can result in a restriction. In this case, complying with Moneipoint's process is the only way to lift the PND and receive the refund.
10. Fraud Complaint from Impersonation via Hacked Social Accounts
One of the most common forms of online fraud today is impersonation via hacked social accounts like WhatsApp. 
Fraudsters may gain access to someone's account, use it to scam others, and channel money into a bank account created under false pretences.
If your account is flagged as being involved in such fraudulent activities, even unknowingly, a PND can be placed. 
This restriction ensures that the funds are frozen and cannot be moved while the situation is being investigated. If you've been hacked or impersonated, report the issue to the appropriate authorities and work with your financial institution to clear your name.
Conclusion
Dealing with a PND restriction can be quite frustrating. However, it is essential to understand that it is usually done to protect you as the account holder and Moniepoint from fraud or compliance issues. 
Whether it's due to a scheme rule violation, a stolen phone, erroneous transactions, or regulatory blocks, you can resolve the issue by cooperating with your support officials and financial institutions and providing the necessary documentation.

Moniepoint MFB announces security feature to enhance customer protection and fraud prevention
byBemigho Awala
Nigeria's definitive bank for small and medium-sized businesses, as well as their customers and employees, Moniepoint Microfinance Bank has made securing digital payments a top priority, implementing the need for additional Factor of Authentication by customers when making payments. It has introduced a Multi Factor Authentication, MFA on its mobile and web applications, designed to simplify the payment experience, increase transaction success rates, and significantly enhance security for consumers and businesses. 
The MFA, which will apply to transactions over the sum of five hundred thousand naira and five million naira on the Moniepoint Personal Banking and Business Banking apps respectively, combines the ease of seamless payment experience with robust security measures, meeting both customer aspirations for convenience and regulator’s stringent authentication requirements. Moniepoint's MFA leverages advanced device-based biometric technology, such as fingerprint or facial recognition and token-based Time-based One-Time Password (TOTP) to authenticate payments swiftly and securely. 
According to Babatunde Olofin, Managing Director, Moniepoint MFB, 'At Moniepoint, we take pride in serving the financial services ecosystem by consistently leading the way, bringing innovative payment solutions that are safe, secure and easy to adopt, aligning with our vision of creating financial happiness across Nigeria. When people’s accounts are safe, the feeling of safety permeates and fuels the happiness that they experience across other areas of their lives.' 
Olofin continues, 'we fully recognize the potential and impact of multi-factor authentication (MFA) in unlocking opportunities for innovative and secure payment solutions, all while maintaining the highest levels of customer trust. This solution further demonstrates our dedication to customer-centricity, keeping in step with regulatory requirements and compliance while deploying solutions that meet the evolving needs of our users.'
Traditionally, financial institutions have deployed three methods of authenticating clients that include card & PIN, digital login and password, and knowledge-based questions. Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) typically requires two or more forms of identity verification, such as something you know (password, key code, question), something you possess (phone/email code, token, physical key), or something you are (fingerprint, biometrics).



It will be recalled that earlier this year, Monieppoint introduced a USSD code, *5573# to increase security, convenience and accessibility while safeguarding customer funds in case of loss or theft of mobile phones. When existing customers, encompassing business and personal accounts, log onto their mobile banking app, they will receive a prompt and or notification to update their settings with a biometric credential in order to activate this feature.  
Financial experts have commended this latest move by Moniepoint, as the MFA system balances security with user experience whether you have a feature phone or own the latest smartphone device.  By implementing MFA, consumers are not only safeguarding their personal, financial and professional data but also taking a stand for a safer online world.

What’s the Point: Why social media giveaways should scare you
byEmmanuel Paul
You or someone you know probably participated in a social media giveaway at some point—tagged a friend, shared a post, or dropped your location or best three photos. Then, you drop your bank account details to claim your prize. But what if I told you that sometimes, you were the prize?
These contests might look harmless, but they get you to share personal information that could be used to scam you and your loved ones, or used to commit fraud. In 2022, users lost $1.2 billion to scams on social media globally. I’m sure it’s easy to avoid the usual suspects, like suspicious DMs or investment opportunities that are too good to be true. But what about non-obvious ones we regard as fun, like giveaways?  
Don’t get me wrong—giveaways are a tested and trusted marketing tactic. Our focus here is the risk posed to users by bad actors. 
To understand this issue, I spoke with Albert, Moniepoint’s Chief Information Security Officer. Here’s how he highlighted the relationship between psychology and how insidious social media scams can be. 
The engineering behind giveaways
Social media giveaways blend in with the noise of your regular social media activities, so you don’t even realise there’s an issue. But as Albert points out, this is how social engineering works—by exploiting our natural tendencies and our trust in seemingly harmless interactions.
 Social engineering is all about tricking people into giving up their personal information. It’s been around for years, from phishing emails to fake tech support calls. These scams prey on our trust and instincts, and they’ve gotten more creative over time. Here are some common types:
Phishing: Fake emails or messages designed to steal login details or personal info.
Baiting: Offering something tempting (like a free download) to get people to click.
Pretexting: Pretending to be someone trustworthy to gather information.
Spear Phishing: Highly targeted attacks, often based on personal details you’ve shared.
Vishing and Smishing: Phone and SMS-based scams that convince you to share personal data.
These bad actors get this information through several means, but we thought to point out methods hiding in plain sight. 
Giveaways: A Trojan horse in plain sight
Giveaways are awesome and several legitimate companies use them, so it’s typically difficult to know which is real and which is not. Here’s how to spot them:
Posts that ask for too much
 If a giveaway asks for personal details like your bank account or phone number, that’s a red flag. Legitimate giveaways shouldn't ask for sensitive info in public.
Posts that mimic legitimate brands
Scammers create fake giveaways that look like they’re from well-known brands. Always double-check the account hosting the giveaway to see if it’s verified or legitimate.
Scammers lurking in comments
Even if the brand is real, scammers often pose as the company or other users in the comments. They’ll ask for your info under the guise of helping you win.
Why you should be scared 
Your account could get compromised
Scammers gather your public info—like your pet’s name, favourite club, or first car—to answer security questions and reset your accounts. They combine this with other personal details to hack into your email, bank, and social media. 
Your SIM could be hijacked. When you drop your phone number in a giveaway, scammers can use it to perform SIM swaps. They take over your phone number and intercept OTPs (One-Time Passwords) to access your bank accounts. 
Fake accounts could be created in your name
Your details can be used to create fake accounts for fraud or money laundering. You won’t even know your name is being used in illegal activities until it’s too late.
It could also be used as a conduit illicit funds. Scammers could scam someone else and spread the money across multiple accounts. Such scenarios could lead the law enforcement to your doorstep. 
Other dangers: Scammers could use spear phishing to send personalised emails based on your interests, like offering fake deals on items you’ve posted about. They can also steal your identity to frame you for crimes, or use details like your address or routine to target you or your family for stalking or kidnapping.
It’s not just giveaways
It’s not just giveaways that put you at risk. Nostalgic or fun trends like the ten-year challenge or quizzes might seem fun, but they reveal personal details scammers can exploit. Check-ins and location tags give away your routine, making it easier to track your movements.
Even anniversary posts can be risky, revealing info like your friend’s name or where you met. Odd viral questions, like 'What’s your account balance based on your BVN?' are red flags—scammers are always looking for ways to gather your data.
What do you do? 
So, should you avoid giveaways entirely? Maybe not, but you should be cautious. 
Do your research: 'Before you enter any contest, ask yourself: who’s really behind this giveaway? Data brokers run a surprising number of these contests, not the brands you think you’re engaging with.'
Avoid public sharing: Avoid any that ask for sensitive information like your bank details or phone number in a public space. Scammers might be lurking in the comments section of legitimate giveaways. Stick to those who keep the process private, engaging you through DMs instead of public posts.
Do the basics: Activate multi-factor authentication and privacy filters on all your accounts and your phone. 
Go tech savvy: If you live for the thrill and must participate, at least use email aliases or disposable phone numbers. 
How Moniepoint protects you
Beyond your typical features like PINs, and multifactor authentication, we’ve added some extra layers for even more protection. When I switched to a new device, Moniepoint asked me to scan my face. It wasn’t just any scan—there’s a liveness check to ensure it’s not a photo, which is great if someone tries logging in elsewhere. You can also monitor your account activity for suspicious logins.
If you have a Moniepoint card, there’s no name or number on it to reduce identity theft. Plus, you have full control: block the card for ATMs, online shopping, or POS use, or even disable it entirely.
We also educate users through our blog on how to stay safe online. Hopefully, this article helps you think twice about what you share, keeping both you and your loved ones safe.

Balancing my passion and making impact as an enterprise architect with Moniepoint - John Ojetunde
byJohn Ojetunde
If you ask my colleagues what they know about me, many would say I am an 'Ajala'. This stems from my adventurous spirit and my love for travel, especially since I have been to almost all countries in Europe. Now that I think about it, is there any place in Europe that I haven’t visited? Oh well, let me finish writing this story and think about it. 
My name is John, and I work as an enterprise architect for Moniepoint. I’ve been at Moniepoint cumulatively for 6 years, but in that time I've left the team and returned. Beyond travelling, I love getting positive reviews about products and features from users, which serves as fuel for the work I do. 
Let’s get into the story…
PS: Ajala means someone who loves to travel a lot. 
Away from travel, how I got started with tech 
I’ve gotten a bit of a reputation with our team internally for always being someone who travels, but way before that, I had very different ideas for what I wanted to do with my life while growing up. 
I always thought I was going to study medicine and become a medical doctor. But right before I filled out my exam form, I thought to myself, studying to be a medical doctor means having to sit down in a place and read for a very long time. At that point in time, I was not ready for that as I prefer to read in batches. So, I registered myself for Computer Science at the University of Ibadan. 
I started trying to build stuff during my first year at the university. I quickly found a mentor at that time because that’s one thing that would really help anyone who wants to grow.  By the time I was in my 300 level, I was working for a company and even used to go to the office once a week. Everything just blew up from then. 
The journey before Moniepoint 
One of the best decisions I’ve made was to start working while still in school. So by the time I was done schooling, I would say I was fairly grounded and had the confidence to shoot for the stars. 
With this conviction, I relocated from Ibadan to Lagos in pursuit of better opportunities. Shortly after, I went to Ghana to work as a software developer. 
Relocating to Ghana was quite exciting as someone who loves being in new places and learning about new cultures. While at my company in Ghana, I kept doing stuff they told me not to do. Don’t get me wrong, the reason why I continued doing stuff they told me not to do was because whatever I was doing kept working. So, I didn’t see any reason to stop doing what I was doing. 
That part of my career reminds me of the movie Three Idiots. In fact, at that time, I had to do a lot of things that my then boss did not agree with and they wanted me to keep doing things manually. At a point, we were almost always at loggerheads as I would do things alternatively, and they would still turn out good. 
Eventually, I had to leave that company as I didn’t see the opportunity for growth. It seemed like my creativity was constantly going to be suppressed, and I didn’t want that to be my reality. 
My first stop at Moniepoint 
After leaving the company in Ghana, I came back to Lagos and continued applying to other places. Soon, I found myself at Moniepoint in 2018, and almost immediately, it felt like home working at this company. 
At that time in Moniepoint, everyone had to take ownership of a lot of things which is something that didn’t really happen at my previous company. Then, Moniepoint had solutions that we had to customise and deploy to banks. This means that as a developer, you have to act as a product manager, tester and user. You also have to go to the bank to get the solution working. I was appreciative of this as it meant I had to push myself beyond my limits. 
So of course, if you are interested in growth like me, it was a very good opportunity for me.  During that period, we were working on a product called Moneytor. Moneytor managed the merchants and POS acquiring process end to end and enabled businesses/merchants to track incoming payments and make outgoing payments. This part of my career also resonates with maybe 007 or even Blade, which is like that guy that comes to save the day, especially when you have production issues then you just sit down day by day, and you're just killing stuff.
TeamApt Days

The crossroad 
In 2019, I got the opportunity to relocate from Nigeria, and it was something I could not turn down. Sadly, there was no opportunity of working from outside Nigeria for Moniepoint at the time,
It was a tough decision to make, but speaking to Felix made everything better. Felix encouraged those of us who wanted to leave that we could but that he would come back for us at the right time. 
As of when I left Moniepoint in 2019, I was already an enterprise architect. After leaving, I did a couple of certification exams and worked with a few companies, including a UK company.
Then, something happened…
Guess who called?
If you guessed Felix already, you’re right! 
In 2021, Felix called, saying it was time to return to Moniepoint, and who can say no to Felix?
I’ve been with Moniepoint since then, and I currently work as an Enterprise Architect. This means that my primary job is to unblock anybody in the team. It includes Quality Assurance engineers, Technical Product Managers, Product Managers, etc.
Another responsibility I carry out is engineering management. I’m also the first person who should have a holistic view of our infrastructure and whatever the team is building. I also have to think of how we can integrate with other teams and how we can reuse what other teams have done. 
As an enterprise architect, I also get to teach. This is important because one day, you would want other people to be able to do some of the things you’ve done. 
I like that the work I do is very rewarding, especially as I work as an enterprise architect with the Point-of-Sale (POS) channel at Moniepoint, and you can feel the impact of my role internally and externally.  
The role of an enterprise architect in this case is very integral as we work to ensure that there is no downtime on the POS. When there is no downtime, there is increased customer satisfaction, leading to the success of the organisation. 
As an organisation focused on helping businesses and individuals power their dreams, being able to provide business owners with our point-of-sale device is bringing business owners several steps closer to fulfilling their dreams. We have made it possible for the business owner to make requests for POS devices easily & securely, without leaving their homes, shops, or offices. 
Beyond providing the POS device, we have also made sure that it is reliable as we don’t want business owners having difficulty receiving payments from customers because the POS device is down. We have made our transfer feature on the POS very fast to ensure reliability. 
When you transfer to a Moniepoint POS, there is an instant notification that happens on the POS, and you are good to go. This means you can even go cashless if you wish. For users, this brings them happiness that they can transfer and don’t have to wait for any rigorous form of confirmation. 
How I have succeeded in my role as an enterprise architect 
In my role, I have had to work on my technical skills to increase technical depth as you need to be technically sound to succeed as an enterprise architect. This involves knowing how to resolve issues in a way that they are permanently resolved, leaving no chance for them to reoccur. 
As an enterprise architect, you also need to have soft skills. Most times, you are not writing code, you are managing people. You need to know how to motivate people in a way that they push themselves even beyond their limits.  It helps knowing how to inspire people who work with you in the team. 
It is also helpful to have a sense of humility - NO Ego. People should know that you don’t know it all. This gives room for you to learn more.
Respect is also very important. You need to be humble and create an atmosphere where your team members will be able to talk and relate with you. They need to see that you are also human like them.
The other side of me 
No, this isn’t the part where I talk about the book or the movie. However, aside being an Enterprise Architect, I also do a lot of coaching and mentorship. 
There’s really a part of my career that is just solely based on academics, which is teaching. During COVID, I was part of a training school for Latvian and Polish women who wanted to switch to tech, and there was also this partnership with Accenture.
So, I taught there for some months. It was delightful that about 80% of them got internship positions in Accenture and they’re doing great now. 
I believe that the only way you can know if you are well grounded in a field is when you can teach it very well. While teaching, you will probably see the gap in your knowledge through questions and the like.
I’m very passionate about imparting knowledge as I believe it is a chain reaction. If a senior engineer can take up one person and mentor them, you are increasing the quality of your team altogether. That person would teach another person, and the chain continues. This means you are increasing the quality of engineers in the tech industry at large. 
I always tell my teammates, I don’t want you to be a senior engineer in just Moniepoint. I want you to be a senior engineer anywhere you are in the world. My goal is to make you a better person while doing your job. 
At Moniepoint, I think we have successfully done mentorship through the Women in Tech program and internship opportunities. I recommend that every organization should be passionate about teaching and mentorship. However, it is easier when you find people who want to learn as it is difficult to teach people who do not want to grow. 
I am very passionate about teaching. Maybe someday in the future, I will have an academy.
If you’ve enjoyed my story and you would love to work with me at Moniepoint, I’m sure there’s an opening for you! Head on to our careers page now and apply!

Meet the doctor who’s creating web experiences at Moniepoint.
byChioma Ibekwe
I can explain, I promise. My journey has been a bit wild, so buckle up. I’m Chioma, and I’m a user experience designer at Moniepoint. I haven’t always been a user experience designer, though. I found my way here by continuously exploring the things that fascinate me, and here’s a look at what it’s been like.
That time when I quit being a doctor.
I started my design journey after I had completed my medical housemanship. I graduated as a medical doctor from the University of Lagos and immediately started my housemanship. If you’re familiar with medical school, you know graduating is a highlight. Getting free of med school work and finally beginning to practice was typically the goal, but not exactly for me.
Yup, that's me. And you don't want to see what I was looking at
Without a flair for being a doctor, I had just been going through the motions for quite a while, and every passing moment brought me closer to doing what I wanted. When I finalised my one-year housemanship training, I took the bold step and quit medicine.
It was time to do the things I wanted.
The winded journey to user experience design
As you can imagine, neither of my parents was particularly happy with my decision to leave my medical career behind. There’s little else as pleasing to an African parent as a doctor-daughter. However, I was dead set on finding things I actually enjoyed and exploring them.
My first shot at design was interior design. I got certifications for it and worked as an interior designer. I consider this my first step into design, but it didn’t quite land. I wasn’t enjoying it as much as I hoped, and in Nigeria, the interior design industry isn’t very standardised. So, I decided to find something else.
It was at this point that my brother introduced me to product design. He noticed my flair for design and thought it could be explored more fully in this field. And boy, was he right! A few months into my journey as a designer, I learned about the Moniepoint women-in-tech internship and decided to give it a shot. You can imagine how that went.
Exploring web design at Moniepoint
I joined the team as a User Experience designer. Still, over the past year, my role has let me focus more on designing web experiences, especially for the Marketing and Communications teams. This happened in such a random way. When I joined Moniepoint in 2022 as a Women in Tech intern, our structure meant that we had requirements from different departments/ teams.
Adrian, the SVP of Design, would assign different projects to different team members. We had this brief from the Marketing team, so he just placed me and someone else on a website project, and we did that. Then when the next marketing request came in, my previous experience with it meant that I was the better option to work on it. 
From then, I found myself being nominated for more marketing websites, and that's how I found myself here—creating many web experiences for websites and mobile.
Full circle moments - the 2023 women-in-tech website
I absolutely enjoyed designing the current women in tech website, and working on it was such a full-circle moment for me. It was exciting because it was one of the first projects I was entrusted with. I had just been an intern in the same program and had gotten accepted to join the team full-time, so I was still a relatively new designer in the company.
Being one of my first projects, it felt like I had a point to prove—not just to myself but to everyone who would come across the website. It was my way of showing what I was capable of and fully exploring my creativity. I was saying to everyone who came across it, 'Hey! It’s possible to try different things and succeed, no matter your background.'
With product design, you have a set design system, and the product has to look a particular way every time. You are, therefore, always conforming to the design system, which can be mechanical and boring. With website design, however, I can be as free and creative as I want to be, and this is my favourite part about designing web experiences.
What my process looks like
I get briefs describing what needs to be done and what we’re trying to accomplish. The Comms team, for example, gives me a backstory, target audience, what the audience likes, and what they are trying to communicate. 
When I was tasked with designing the website for the Informal Economy report, I took everything the Comms team gave me in the brief, brainstormed, did a lot of research and then drew up wireframes.
I put everything together and designed a couple of options that fit the goal they were trying to achieve. I then took it back to the stakeholders, who gave me their feedback while I gave mine based on my findings during the research phase.
Then, I created a prototype. That included hooking up the website with interactions because people like seeing things that move well. That’s important because it helps to visualise how the website flows when users go through it and how things work together. Once that is done, we work with the engineering team to ensure everything is tidied up and looks good before launching.
Design considerations at Moniepoint
As a part of the design team at Moniepoint, there are a few things we always make a priority. One important thing is ensuring that text is legible on mobile. People should be able to read what’s on the page without difficulty, or else, what’s the point of having a website at all?
That forms a part of the larger considerations we make around accessibility. From the use of colours to the CTAs and buttons, everything is optimised to provide the user with the best experience. 
When I’m not designing, I’m designing.
I’m supposed to close this out with what I do for fun, but I honestly don’t think I’m a fun person. When I’m not designing web experiences, I like to do 3D designs. Doing 3D designs calms me down, so I immerse myself in it when I need to decompress.
I also love to read. If you like horror slash, thriller slash mysteries, and Stephen King, then you’re my kind of person.
The journey ahead
Today, I’m all about expanding my knowledge and improving my skills. My parents have seen that this is something I love and am good at, and that’s brought them to my side again. User experience design is expansive and I wish I had started off way earlier, but I’m applying myself to trying new things and being better at it everyday.
If you’d like to work with a team where you get to create meaningful things, we’ve got a space for you. Visit our careers page.

Bringing Joseph’s business back from the edge
byVictory Okoyomoh
Across Nigeria, markets are a lot more than just a gathering of people looking to make a trade. For people like Joseph, who spend their lives surrounded by them, they often form the experiences that decide the path they eventually take. 
When Joseph finished his university education in 2017 at the age of 35, many of his friends were concerned about getting formal employment. There was constant income to be secured without the ups and downs that were rife in owning a business.
But he was determined to become a businessman, and a few things had led him down this path.
Growing up in Akwa Ibom State, Nigeria, he had often been mocked for being the son of a 'provision store' owner. 'People believe that the provision business is all about making N5 naira, but there’s a lot more to it,' he says.
What made Joseph different from others, is that he grew up surrounded by a thriving business community, spending most days in the market. Where other people looked down on business owners, he knew exactly how much success was possible by going down that path.
Two people influenced his perspective – his father, and another wealthy merchant in the market where he grew up.
'This man looked haggard - he wore slippers around all the time and never had his shirt tucked in -  but everyone in the market knew that was far from his reality,'  Joseph recalls. 'Sometimes a truck brings 5000 cartons of goods to the market, and where everyone else struggles for a few, this man easily collects about half of it.'
Joseph’s father explained that this man had started as a roadside kerosene seller in the market. But the person Joseph saw did not match that picture at all, and that inspired him.
While his father and this merchant seemed poor, their commitment to building sustainable businesses helped them both find wealth. Where other people looked down on business owners, he grew a sense of pride because he saw all that was possible.
With this image in mind, he worked for his father for a year after school and eventually took over in 2018.
Joseph quickly saw business success, but there were also pitfalls. In his line of business, losses often happen in two ways.
'The first is from your staff. Being a cash-intensive business, bulk sums often needed to be taken to banks. 'Sometimes you count money in volume, and when you give someone to take it to the bank, it’s N30,000 less. Sometimes that’s even more than the profit you made, and you can’t even tell if it’s true or not'.
The other more serious problem, was how often he experienced robbery. In his line of business, he had been robbed a few times before. But when he came into his shop in October, it was one time too many. Confused, he locked his store, went back home and remained indoors for two days.
This time, it wasn’t just about the money. He also had a building project at the time that he didn’t want to stop, so he needed more money. For a businessman who had built what he had from scratch, getting loans was never something he had considered. Pride in his business, and confusion about the process made him unlikely to get one.
But something had to give.
Joseph’s first encounter with Moniepoint was as a payment solutions provider, and bank. By digitising his payments, he solved the first problem he had with cash. He no longer needed to send anyone to the bank, since they could pay to him digitally, and the holes where his profit dripped through were plugged.
However, providing access credit was the turning point for Joseph’s business. After his last robbery encounter, he needed some money to bring his business back from the edge, and he got that with Moniepoint.
70% of informal business owners borrow money for their business.
We recently launched a report on Nigeria’s informal economy, taking a close look at the sector, which accounts for almost 90% of MSMEs in the country. One of the things we found was that 7 in 10 business owners have gotten some sort of external funding for their business.
The bulk of them (71%) receive this funding from family and friends.

What’s the point of USSD banking?
byEmmanuel Paul
One of the first things you learn when getting a phone in an African country, is how to use USSD. To recharge your phone, to buy data, or subscribe to a new call tariff plan. Today, USSD has become so popular, that it’s safe to say so many people would not know what banking is, if not for USSD.   
However, if you ask anyone what Unstructured Supplementary Service Data is, chances are they’re going to stay back at you with a blank face. So it got us asking, where did USSD come from? How does it work? And, most importantly,  why is USSD technology still relevant today? 
We went a little bit down history lane, and we invited Mohammed, one of our Technical Product Managers, along for the ride as we try to answer our favourite question - What’s the point of USSD? 
First, where did USSD come from?
To understand USSD, we first need to go back to the creation of the Global System for Mobile Communications (GSM) in 1987 Europe. Now stay with me. Mobile phones work with radio waves; you can think of them as highways but for voice and data, instead of vehicles.
For it to work well, you need to develop standards (traffic rules) so everyone stays in the right lane, so it won’t look like Lagos traffic. While the US and Russia went with CDMA, Europe went with GSM, and so did Africa. 
In March 1997, the European Telecommunications Standards Institute (ETSI) published a document recommending a protocol that allows subscribers to communicate with their service providers. Few years later, the USSD protocol was created. 
Turns out, early adopters of mobile phones used post-paid plans and didn’t need to query their service providers often.  Now, it was a different story in Africa. Telcos introduced prepaid plans, and users had to dial USSD codes more often. 
By 2007, Safaricom leveraged USSD and SIM took kit to launch Mpesa, a mobile money service that became a massive hit in East Africa. In Nigeria, GT Bank launched the *737# service in 2012, and other banks promptly followed. 
How does USSD work in banking? 
So we know the USSD is a protocol that lets you the user communicate directly with your service provider, that’s why, before code harmonisation, *556# worked on an MTN line but wouldn’t work on Airtel. When you access banking services, your network provider acts as the traffic controller between you and your bank. 
When you hit *5573#, for example, the provider knows this is a Moniepoint code, and redirects your query to Moniepoint. But hitting that code is just the beginning of the flow due to the restricted nature of USSD. 
'Dialing the code tells us the customer wants to do something with us, but we now need to know what they want to do. So we now show them, say, five things they can do. 1. Transfer, 2. Buy airtime. If the user selects 1, it will ask to input account number,' says Mohammed. 
These days, banking apps and PoS devices let you do so much more, but the USSD platform is still gaining traction. The value of USSD transactions move from N2.9 trillion in 2020 to over N5 trillion in 2021? We got even more curious when the Moniepoint product team came up with the plan to launch a *5573# USSD service for customers. 
Why is USSD still relevant? 
In 2022, Nigerians processed 515 million USSD transactions and its growing popularity is for good reason. It serves both the financially underserved and served. 
Serving the underserved means more people can enter the financial system if they own a mobile phone. The number of smartphones in Nigeria is estimated to be around 25 - 40 million. The number of BVNs that exist alone leaves at least 20 million people in the banking sector who don’t have a smartphone. 
Even those with smartphones find USSD an easy way to quickly access banking transactions. Mohammed holds that simplicity is key to the success of USSD technology in banking. 
'It’s an easy way to get things done. It can be done on any phone as long as you have a valid sim, it doesn’t require an internet connection, and most importantly, it’s very simple, and you can’t build complicated flows or features even if you tried.'
How Moniepoint thinks about USSD
At its core, we see the creation of USSD as key to achieving true financial inclusion for millions of Nigerians. Until now, you needed a smartphone and a bit of tech savvyness to use the Moniepoint App (Personal or Business). Sometimes, some of our BRMs help to explain how the app works to some non-tech-savvy people, but that’s not scalable.
'Most people are already familiar with it because they use it for many more things (buying airtime, activating a data plan with your telecom providers…etc.'
We also created features to help users block/unlock their accounts or those of friends and family. We did this while placing reasonable security measures in case of theft.

Getting started as a product manager at Moniepoint: an inside guide
byChidinma Enemanna
If you’ve ever wondered what it’s like to be a product manager at Moniepoint, you’re not alone. I was curious too, and decided to give it a spin - what if I explored it from the eyes of someone who just joined the team?
That path led me to Priya, a Technical Product Manager at Moniepoint, and I'm sure you’ll find it as fascinating as I did. Come with me, let's chat with Priya!
Hi Priya! Tell me a bit about your background and how you got into product management
Hi Chidinma. I grew up in a middle-class family in India. In our culture, being an engineer or doctor is something we all aspire to become. My parents wanted me to study hard and become an engineer or a doctor. 
In high school, I was super interested in mathematics, so I chose engineering instead of medicine. However, I didn’t know that engineering was less related to mathematics and more related to actual engineering stuff. I was like a fish out of water with no idea what I was getting into. Eventually, in the final year, I got super interested in programming. That kick-started my career as a software engineer. 
I worked for about eight years as a software engineer and rose to become a senior software engineer and even a team lead. Then, I moved to Germany for two years and worked as a senior software engineer. Then, I became an engineering manager, which involved a bit of management along with engineering. This gave me a broader view of engineering, especially its business side. 
I realised that the business side of engineering was interesting and important. I also saw that multiple aspects of business come into play. I became curious and wanted to know why we do what we do. That was how I started reading about product management. 
Sounds like you’ve been at this for quite a while! So, how did you become a technical product manager at Moniepoint? 
Well, let me save you the boring details of how a recruiter reached out to me, and we got talking. However, when speaking with Moniepoint’s recruiter, I was impressed with how the role was defined because it had the perfect amalgamation of the technical and business sides. 
I had read about product management before, but I was not sure whether I really wanted to leave the technical side of my career because I enjoy coding and understanding the technical design of any project or system. Basically, the technical product manager role at Moniepoint was going to include a lot and a bit of both.  
What do I mean by a lot and a bit? The role required a lot of technical depth, but at the same time, you own the complete product. This means you also get to interact with all the stakeholders who are involved in the project. 
I’ll give you an example. Currently, I am working on the reconciliation and settlement side of Monnify. This involves talking to not just engineers but also reconciliation officers on a daily basis. The settlement and reconciliation leads are those who talk to the actual business owners who are using the Monnify product. They have data, feedback, and reports from merchants using the Monnify product. Then, I’m also talking to the engineers who are working on making that product and improving it on a daily basis. 
This is a perfect balance of technical and product ownership. My role requires me to be responsible for the product but without sacrificing the technical side. This made me interested in the role when the recruiter reached out, as it was a perfect fit for my technical side. 
  
Very Interesting. So, what would be your advice if I want to become a technical product manager?
I think number one is that you should be passionate or enthusiastic about the product and the domain. I am very, very interested in this domain, which is why the role excites me more. But in general, if there is enthusiasm about understanding and dissecting the product, I think it would be a great attribute to have when you want to become a product manager. 
The second thing is that as a TPM, you should have either technical knowledge or technical skills because you would be talking to enterprise architects and engineers. You would also be interacting with a lot of tables, talking about SQL, making SQL scripts, and dealing with the technical side day to day. Now, I don’t think everyone has to be a coder or programmer, but having a good understanding of SQL and how systems are designed would be helpful. 
There should also be a bit of creativity, as you might also be looking for gaps in the product and pitching the idea to your stakeholders. Product managers are sometimes also responsible for proposing new features and improving the existing features by talking to the stakeholders and the actual end users, so maybe a little bit of creativity and a vision for the product.
 
How do you define and measure the success of a product?
It truly depends on the nature of the project. In my past projects, I have seen that sometimes the success metrics are usually defined even at the inception of the project. By the end of the project, you look back to see whether you have achieved all those metrics. 
Success could also have some mathematical metrics attached to it. It could be some features that we decided on in the very beginning. If they are fulfilled, we could say that the project is successful. Or, it could be something that the project became during execution.  
In the end, one of the most important things is whether the actual audience and end users are happy or not. The actual success would be when the merchants use the product and confirm that it is functioning the way they want.  
This all sounds like a lot of work, and I’m sure it is, so how do you unwind from work? 
If you had asked me this question a year ago, I would have had a lot of answers. However, I just recently became a mother, and things have changed a little bit. 
Before, it was usually yoga and dancing. I love to dance and used to go to studios to unwind before COVID. But for the past months, I have been unwinding with my son. After work, I try to spend time with him. Sometimes, we go for walks; other times, we watch children-friendly movies together.  My son keeps me on my toes, for sure.  
 
Awwwn. Wrapping up, what has been your favourite part about working with Moniepoint?
I know it's been just a few months working with Moniepoint, but I've enjoyed the people and impact so much.   I’m always happy when I read about the strides that Moniepoint is making. For example, I was pleased by the huge impact we are making with the recent launch of the Informal Economy Report.  
Overall, I'm hugely impressed with how Moniepoint has worked and is working towards making an impact on the economy and the country's overall financial growth.
I also like how Moniepoint treats its employees, giving them room for growth and career progression. This way, they stay loyal to the company.  I remember reading a story on the blog about someone who transitioned from customer support to product management. 
Some people have spent years in Moniepoint. By years, I mean those who were actually the founding people and even founding engineers are still here. My manager is a great example, and he has been here since the inception of Moniepoint. This shows that the company has great values that encourage employees to stay loyal.  
I’m excited about my journey with Moniepoint ahead!

Thank you for your time Priya!

Moniepoint’s inception through the eyes of its very first employee.
byVictory Okoyomoh
In my almost two years at Moniepoint, I’ve had the opportunity to speak with quite a number of people on the engineering team. A few minutes into the conversation with Emeka about his decade at Moniepoint, I decided that he’s quite unlike many of them. 
From making a detour after years of wanting to be a doctor and then another to computer science just as the iPhone was gaining popularity, Emeka describes his journey with one word - Serendipitous. And given that he’s gone from being the first employee at what was just a bright idea, to SVP of Customer Success Tools at Africa’s fastest-growing fintech, it’s not hard to see why. 
Drifting in and out, you see the road you’re on.
Emeka describes the first phase of his time at Moniepoint with the genre 'Dream Pop'. If, like me, you don’t know what that is, you can start with this song by Beach House. One thing that seems to stand out for him is that he almost did not join Moniepoint. Having come to Nigeria just for his NYSC with a clear plan to return for his Master’s degree as soon as he was done, joining a startup as its first employee was not exactly in the picture. But this would not be the first time he’d be changing his path.
'I used to carry medical books around when I was younger. My grandfather lost his sight, so I wanted to be a surgeon when I grew up, so I could possibly save his sight and that of others', Emeka recalls. But he had a reassessment just before he got into college to do biology as a premed. Did the person he was at that moment want to be a doctor, or was that just some dream he clung to from his childhood?
Realising he felt no strong passion for it, he decided to lean towards electrical engineering, just like his father. He started and was doing fine, still, he hadn’t quite found his path yet, and admits that he lost interest at some point. He then started to fall in love with programming, and around him, the technological climate was changing.
'Some of my friends in engineering had changed their majors to computer science. At that point in time, my first year in college was when the new iPhone came out. So, just seeing all that was going on around apps and tech started pushing me towards that. I had a conversation with my dad about it, and while he disagreed, he understood in the end and pushed me towards it. I changed my major to computer science and graduated.'
Chance meetings at Computer Warehouse Group
The National Youth Service Corps (NYSC) is a mandatory, post-tertiary scheme set up by the Nigerian government. Every young Nigerian is required to undergo it, and Emeka’s year in this scheme would mark another pivotal point in his path to Moniepoint.
'My professional journey began at Computer Warehouse Group (CWG), where I was doing my NYSC. There, I met Chidum (current SVP, Engineering at Moniepoint) and Tosin, who was selling a solution to CWG then.'
'I sort of enjoyed the job I had.  I started as a software engineer, customising pre-existing banking applications. This role provided me with a foundational understanding of the financial technology landscape, but I wasn’t given the kind of responsibility I’d have liked. I was leaning towards product management, but there was no opportunity for that, and then I started hearing conversations around me having to leave. I spoke to Chidum about it, and he had also heard the same. He suggested I should speak to Tosin'.
Tosin’s apartment in 1004 is an iconic piece of Moniepoint’s early history, and like many of the company’s first employees, Emeka had an experience there, too.
'I met with Tosin, and he explained in detail what he was trying to do. I still remember some of the words he said to this day. He described how ambitious his goal was but also how possible it was. And at that moment, I said Yes.'
Tosin was clearly dissatisfied with how things were, and Emeka was sold on his vision to execute things differently. He walked into the apartment unsure of his next step but walked out absolutely sure that he wanted to be part of whatever Tosin was building.
Adrian, Felix, Emeka and Dumebi at 1004.
Ready, rock & roll…
Emeka’s soft-spoken voice and tempo pick up as we begin to talk about his first and favourite project at Moniepoint - Profectus. Perhaps rightly so, too, because he compares this phase of his Moniepoint journey to the Rock genre - energetic and raw.
'When I joined Moniepoint, I focused on working towards our vision, which we then described as ‘owning the channels’. We wanted to own all the channels of payment processing and payments.'
From software engineer, Emeka soon sought the project manager responsibility he had wanted at CWG and found it on their first major project with Fidelity Bank. They had developed a product called Profectus to automate their back-end processes, significantly improving their operational efficiency. This project was a success and led to more opportunities for the team. As they secured more projects, his role expanded, and he was appointed head of Service Delivery, overseeing the delivery of all of Moniepoint’s B2B products.
However, this was just the start. Soon enough, Emeka became a VP within Moniepoint. 
Leading Profectus
With Profectus's success, the team wanted to grow rapidly and needed people with product context to drive said growth. So, Emeka became VP of Profectus. In this role, he led the expansion of the product as Moniepoint ventured into new markets and closed deals with a larger set of banks locally.
'Profectus is a product that holds a special place in my heart. It was a solution for settlements, reconciliation, customer support, etc. It was a back-office application for e-payments. It was something to help you settle e-payments transactions, reconcile them, and handle customer support. I have a strong affinity for it because I saw the impact immediately.'
While it started as just a project to build something to automate settlements and reconciliations, Profectus ultimately stood as a product of its own. Operations that would typically take hours were taking minutes to seconds. Working from within the bank, they could see the impact directly.
Moneytor, the partner product, managed the merchants and POS acquiring process end to end and enabled businesses/merchants to track incoming payments and make outgoing payments.
Agency Banking set on. 
With both their products serving the majority of banks in Nigeria, the team realised there was a lot more they could do to improve financial services in Nigeria. They decided to serve customers more directly, and Emeka worked on the early parts of Moniepoint’s agency banking product.
After doing their research and becoming certain this was the company's next step, they decided to close the other projects and focus on this one.
'I had enough context on all the other projects, so I had to go back outside to start working to close them. We did this, but by 2021, I had some personal issues that I spoke to Tosin about, which he completely understood. I got an extended time off for about two and a half months, and when I came back, the agency banking product was doing pretty well.
Providing credit to agents
Back from his break, Emeka was ready for his next challenge. With Moniepoint already becoming one of Nigeria’s leading agency banking networks, they wanted to extend their offerings to provide credit.
He led the first iteration of the overdrafts product, which was designed to enable Moniepoint to give credit to agents and small businesses. Leading this initiative required a deep understanding of the market needs, technical expertise, and the ability to manage cross-functional teams effectively. Emeka describes it as a challenging but rewarding experience that significantly impacted the company’s growth and market position.
The product lasted for a year and some months, but soon, it was clear that it couldn’t scale to the needed level. It worked perfectly to provide these agents with microloans, but if it were to provide these businesses with any more, the product would have to be much more thorough.
In parallel, Tobi was building what eventually became working capital loans, using some of the insights that Emeka’s team had gotten. He was able to build that into what it is today, so they shut down the previous version.
Monie trees is the perfect place for shade…
Emeka chooses hip-hop to describe his current position as SVP of customer success tools. Anyone familiar with the genre knows that it’s the perfect blend of the quaint and the modern, bringing decades of refinement into one continuously evolving cultural phenomenon. Nothing embodies this like Kenrick Lamar’s Money Trees.
'One of my current responsibilities is building products like Moniedesk, designed to help our customer support agents resolve issues quickly and efficiently. This product is a testament to our commitment to improving customer service and operational efficiency.'
'Leading a team of Technical Product Managers (TPMs) and working with cross-functional departments like compliance, channels, and payments, I ensure that our products are innovative and compliant with industry regulations. This involves regular meetings, strategic planning, and continuous learning to stay ahead of industry trends.'
Evolving alongside Moniepoint.
There’s a wistful tone in Emeka’s voice as he reaches the end of his retelling. On my end, it’s fascination, and I worry a bit if he’s bothered by the excitement in my voice. I’m unsure what it’s like to work in the same company for nearly a decade, but from everything he’s shared, it sounds quite worth it.
From one lens, it would seem like serendipity, but from where I stand, I see a lot of the core values that make Moniepoint what it is today - Customer empathy, technical depth and the Grit to get things done. His closing statements reflect this.
'Over the years, I have evolved alongside the company, and Moniepoint continues to align with my long-term goals. The experiences and lessons learned over the years have shaped me into the leader I am today. The merit-based culture, recognitions, and compensation make it an outstanding place to build impactful products.'
If you just read this, and you're feeling as pumped as I was, the next step of your career might just be a decade at Moniepoint. The only way to find out is to apply here.

The 5-year check-in: growing my career as a Backend Engineer at Moniepoint 
bySmart Mekiliuwa
What do you call landing a job in the career you had envisioned since you were little? Not just pursuing your dream, but doing so at a company that leaves you feeling accomplished? 
One minute, I’m doing my NYSC, thinking of what the next chapter of my life holds for me. The next, I’m signing my offer letter with Moniepoint (then TeamApt). It’s been five years as a backend engineer at Moniepoint, and here’s my story—from how I got employed to today.
The APT Challenge 
During my NYSC in 2019, I learned about a competition called the Apt Challenge, and curiously, I signed up for it.
The Apt Challenge involved solving five (5) computer-based questions on mathematics and algorithms. The faster you could solve them, the higher you would rise in the leaderboard. The person who emerged as the overall winner solved it in less than a day! 
Just when I was notified of the start of the competition, my laptop crashed. I tried to fix it or find a replacement, but it was seemingly impossible then. Left without an alternative, I decided to use my phone, and you can imagine how stressful it was. 
At the time, people had already solved all five questions. Honestly, I even considered forgoing the competition. But I decided to see it through to the end just for fun, and it took me about a week to finish solving everything.
Only 16 of us were able to solve the challenge, and it was then sorted based on who finished in the quickest time, and a winner was picked. 
There was going to be a reward for those who topped the leaderboard, although I have forgotten now what the reward was. However, it never said that anyone would get employed by the company, but that’s precisely what happened.
A few weeks later, I got a call from Moniepoint’s HRBP, and that’s how I joined the team.
On becoming a DreamMaker 
I officially resumed with Moniepoint in June 2019 as a Software Engineer. To sum up my experience in a phrase, I 'hit the ground running'.
I joined the week we launched Monnify, and it was an incredibly busy period.
Everyone was working hard trying to put out a fire, fix an issue, or answer our merchants who were just being onboarded. I had to pick up things quickly through observation, grabbing as much information as I could in as little time as possible. That period was hectic, but it helped mould me into who I am today. 
Starting as a Software Engineer 1, I quickly scaled up and became a Software Engineer 2. Later, we had a change in our roles, so people were assigned what they were actually doing. So, I was assigned a Backend Engineer. Now, I’m a Senior Backend Engineer. 
What I do as a backend engineer at Moniepoint 
One thing about being a Backend Engineer is that we’re always in the shadows (not in a bad way). I like to think of us as the people who hold down the fort.
As a Senior Backend Engineer at Moniepoint, my work is focused on the Monnify product. Yes, the same Monnify that launched the week I joined. Interesting, isn’t it?
I write and review code for Monnify’s backend services to optimise their performance, and ensure the systems are reliable and can handle high traffic. You will often find me optimising database queries and reducing latency as much as possible. 
I enjoy the work I do because it allows me to interact with other teams, such as Settlement and Reconciliation, Customer Support, and Technical Support. Although we’re on different teams, we all work on the same product, so we all collaborate to ensure its functionality. 
Often, the product team and I have deep dives where we discuss how to architect and implement new backend services and maintain existing ones. From time to time, I am assigned interns and junior software engineers to mentor and help them grow. This is another thing I enjoy about the work I do, because it allows me directly impact the careers of others.
What 5 years of career growth at Moniepoint looks like
Within 5 years at Moniepoint, I have moved from Software Engineer 1 to Software Engineer 2 to Backend Engineer, and now Senior Backend Engineer. 
One crucial aspect at each level has been Technical Depth. We’re a team of extremely talented people, so you need to know your stuff and be good at it. If something is wrong, you need to be able to call it out with confidence and, of course, proof.
Another character trait that has been helpful in scaling up the ranks is Grit. At Moniepoint, we keep trying until we get a solution, as we believe that nothing is impossible when it comes to what we do.  Unless the solution doesn't exist in the world, nothing is really impossible. If it can be done by someone else, then it can be done by us. 
Even though I got into Moniepoint through a competition, I really accepted the offer because of the problems Moniepoint was setting out to solve. Knowing that my work would likely impact people out there was the selling point, and it’s been quite the ride!
If you’re ready to work with a fast-paced team that’s focused on executing results, then click here to join Moniepoint now. You would enjoy career growth and working with fantastic colleagues.

#WhatIDo - A day in the life of a Legal Counsel at Moniepoint.
byGrace Adeloye
Hi, I’m Grace, and I'm a Legal Counsel at Moniepoint.
When I got the life-changing opportunity to join Moniepoint in July 2022, I was super pumped to join the team. During my recruitment process and the in-depth research I did prior to joining Moniepoint, one thing that stood out for me was the level of impact Moniepoint is making in Nigeria. In my mind, I visualised Moniepoint as this amazing blue fairy godmother who goes about sprinkling its awesome fairy dust on the underbanked in Nigeria and, in turn, spreading financial happiness. 
In the last two (2) years, my journey at Moniepoint has been marked with a lot of learning, growth, self-discovery, amazing intellectual challenges, and an opportunity to meet and form lifelong bonds with the brightest minds I have met in my life so far.   

At Moniepoint, we have a moderately sized in-house Legal Team of intelligent and compassionate people who come from different backgrounds and have diverse levels of experience. Excellence is our watchword in the legal team, and we always ensure that we provide top-notch legal support to all stakeholders within the Moniepoint Group.
In establishing a visual representation of how awesome my job is, I'll break down my tasks and everyday interactions as best as I can with minimal legalese.
What my job entails.
As a Legal Counsel, I provide legal support to various business lines and teams within the  Moniepoint Group. Such legal support includes but isn’t limited to:
Drafting and reviewing various types of agreements;
Drafting necessary terms and conditions of use for various products rolled out by the entities within the Moniepoint Group;
Conducting requisite legal due diligence checks on prospective customers who have requested for the grant of a loan;
Managing and overseeing the protection of Moniepoint’s intellectual property; and
Providing general advice to the business on various aspects of the law on which clarity is sought.
Our main goal as a Legal team is to ensure that Moniepoint’s legal risk exposure is reduced to a bare minimum while providing excellent legal support. 
My favourite part of my job is drafting and reviewing agreements. In fact, I do believe my strengths lie in drafting and reviewing agreements. In doing this, there are some key factors to be considered depending on the type of transaction at hand, such as the obligations of the parties, commercial terms (i.e. fees and payment terms), duration of the transaction, the business’s position with regards to risk allocation and liability, indemnification provisions, conditions for termination of the transaction, governing law and dispute resolution (i.e. our preference on the laws of a specific country to be applied to the agreement/ transaction, and our preference on the specific courts/ mechanism through which disputes can be settled). 
The Law as a superpower
I like to tell people that my Law degree is a superpower, allowing me to think critically and propose practical solutions to simple and complex legal and commercial issues. 
The story behind my decision to study law is quite interesting, as this was due to the influence of my elder brother and the environment I grew up in. I was born and raised in an academic environment and spent the greater part of my life at Obafemi Awolowo University (OAU) in Osun State, Nigeria. My parents were members of staff at OAU until their retirement a few years ago, and this afforded me the golden opportunity of living in the OAU senior staff quarters, surrounded by academics and intellectuals.
My elder brother is a Lawyer, and he studied law at OAU. As a child, I would help my brother type out his assignments on the computer and sometimes read his school notes to satisfy my curiosity and learn what the fuss about being a Lawyer was all about. From this point on, I became very curious about the Law, and it's safe to say I was 65% decided on being a Lawyer. 
The defining moment for me to pursue a career in Law happened on my brother’s call to bar day when I followed him to the Supreme Court of Nigeria to write his name on the roll of legal practitioners in Nigeria. It was such a surreal moment for me, and in that moment, I was extremely proud of my brother and all he had achieved. I recall waiting for my brother in the lobby of the Supreme Court, and I saw a giant chandelier which looked absolutely divine. At that moment, I said to myself: 'I want to belong here'. And that was the moment that entirely defined my life and career. I recall I was about 15 years old at this time, and I feel incredibly lucky to have discovered my purpose at such a young age.    
Doing work that matters across different teams
I’m a strong believer in doing work that matters and creating impact through one’s work. This has been a key highlight for me in my journey at Moniepoint. For example, I see our impact in Nigeria, and it makes me so happy and fulfilled. I’m always smiling every time I see or use a Moniepoint point of sale terminal and feel a sense of pride in such moments. 
In the Legal team, we run a legal business partner structure where different Legal Counsels are assigned to various business lines and departments in the Moniepoint Group. This means I provide support to a couple of teams; however, there are a few teams that my work with has been quite notable for me. This is because of the impact their work has had on the company at large, and also because working with these teams has given me the chance to challenge myself intellectually. These teams are the Product team, Mergers and Acquisition team, and the Business Loans teams. 
Products
I enjoy working with the Product team during the process of building/ rolling out a new product and I find this exciting. 
Working with the Project Manager in charge of a product or a new update allows me to understand the product’s details, including how/why we built it, its dynamics, and how it would generate revenue. 
I use all of this product knowledge to put together the appropriate legally sound terms and conditions of use and agreements for such products.
Mergers and Acquisition
Another team I absolutely enjoy working with is the Mergers & Acquisition team. The work done here is very crucial to the growth and expansion of the Moniepoint Group. Working with this team on diverse complex transactions has pushed me out of my comfort zone, granted me the opportunity to learn a lot, mentally challenge myself, and also prove myself and showcase my legal skills.  
Business Loans
The work being done by the Business Loans team sits under the purview of Moniepoint Microfinance Bank Limited (Moniepoint MFB), an entity duly licensed by the Central Bank of Nigeria to provide financial services in Nigeria. 
Revenue generation is a crucial factor and requirement in every organisation, and at Moniepoint MFB, the Business Loans team is doing a fantastic job in this area. Our loan product is one of the most impactful in the market, with an NPL that's way below 1%. Working with the team and being the Legal Counsel assigned to the loans business is one thing I do not take for granted, and I am incredibly proud of, as I actively get to see the way our product impacts business and lives and also helps to build the Nigerian economy.  
My day looks like this:
My day typically starts with me going through my emails to catch up on requests for legal support because even when you're sleeping, the emails don’t stop coming in. After sorting through what I have pending and what has been added to my to-do list from the previous day, I respond to the urgent emails, create my to-do list for the day, and then dive right into the deliverables for the day.
I usually get pulled into various meetings with both internal and external stakeholders and attend these meetings in my capacity as a Legal Counsel, ensuring that necessary guidance is provided on legal issues that may come up during discussions and negotiations. 
In executing my tasks, I make sure I bounce ideas off other members of the Legal team, as no one is an island, and you definitely cannot know it all. I’m a firm believer in collaborating with my colleagues and sharing my knowledge, and I'm always open to superior arguments.  
Working in the Legal team at Moniepoint has been a wonderful experience filled with learning, growth, and purpose. I have had the opportunity to be led by a great Line Manager and leader, and to be surrounded by intelligent and amazing teammates.

Starting your business is an exciting journey and the process of registering a business name is like giving your brand its unique identity. 
It goes beyond just a legal formality to ensuring that you build credibility and trust with customers.

Thanks to the straightforward process on the Moniepoint Business Banking App and the CAC portal, you can easily register your business name yourself without a lawyer. 
Furthermore, the CAC states on its website ' Individual/Proprietors can register business names without the services of the legal practitioner, chartered Accountant or Chartered Secretary.' 
When registering your business name some common challenges you might face include:
Name Availablity Issues: Before registering your business name, you should check for its availability. This is a common mistake business owners make which can ultimately lead to rejection of your application.
Incomplete or Incorrect Documentation: Failure to completely submit the required documents for your business name registration can lead to your approval delay.
Payment Errors: Mistakes in application payment like incorrect fee amount or wrong recipient accounts can lead to a halt in your approval process.
The process of registering your business name is self-explanatory. You can however get legal advice to help in preparing the essential documents and prevent making registration mistakes.
Conclusion
Thanks to the digital advances in the business ecosystem of Nigeria, you can easily register your business name online. By inputting the necessary details on the Moniepoint Business Banking App, you can register your business name and get your certificate of registration within 5 days.

Types of Business Registrations in Nigeria
byChidinma Nwonye
Properly understanding the various types of business name registration done in Nigeria is essential. Meet Ademola, a brilliant ‘go-getter’ and entrepreneur who is excited to get his business running after finalizing market research. 
He’s got the solution, team members, and the resources to get started, however, there’s one last detail. Ademola has to register his business correctly to be legally functional. 
Whether it's you or Ade trying to kick start your entrepreneurial journey, there are many benefits of properly registering your business with the Corporate Affairs Commission in Nigeria. From building credibility, and attracting investors, to avoiding tax and legal complications, there are various pros of registering your business. 
Now you might be wondering, what type of business registration to do and how to go about it. We’ll explore the types of business registration in Nigeria, their various requirements, and more.
The Companies and Allied Matters Act (CAMA) and Corporate Affairs Commission (CAC)
The Companies and Allied Matters Act (CAMA) is the basic legal structure in Nigeria that forms the requirements for establishing, organizing, and managing businesses and companies. 
The Corporate Affairs Commission (CAC), on the other hand, is the legal body authorised with the obligation to regulate the management and formation of companies and businesses in Nigeria. 
The CAC ensures that business owners comply with the CAMA ultimately ensuring the straightforward process of business registration.
8 Types of Business Registration in Nigeria
1. Sole Proprietorship
Sole Proprietorship is one of the oldest forms of business operation in Nigeria. It is a type of business in which a person (known as a sole proprietor) owns and operates a business. 
Also known as an enterprise or a ‘one-man business’, in a sole proprietorship business structure, the owner is legally the same as the business and bears the risks and liabilities incurred by the business. 
However, a good fact about this business structure is that it gives the owner total control over decisions and access to the full profit. Additionally, it gives the owner the ability to operate a corporate business account like Moniepoint MFB under its name. 
For instance, Florence who owns a thrift store can register her business with the CAC as a sole proprietorship where she makes the decisions, has access to the profit, and is responsible for the liabilities the business may incur.

2. Limited Partnership
A Limited Partnership is a business that comprises at least one general partner, one limited partner, and not more than 20 partners. The general partners have unlimited personal liability, i.e., they are responsible for making business decisions and managing the business as a whole. Ademola, for instance, can register his business successfully with the CAC as a Limited Partnership and get his Certificate of Registration.
On the other hand, the limited partners are those whose liabilities are limited to their investment in the business. Also known as silent partners, they are responsible for investing in the business rather than running the day-to-day operations. 
Some examples of businesses that run this structure are real estate businesses, investment companies, etc, and this type of business registration can be done under a business name with the CAC.

3. Limited Liability Partnership
A Limited Liability Partnership (LLP) is a business structure consisting of two or more persons or corporations to make a profit. A distinguishing aspect of an LLP is that it is a legal entity separate from its owners who are liable for only the amount they invest in the business including personal guarantees. 
Furthermore, an LLP can be seen as a combination of a corporation and a partnership and must have at least two partners (individuals, corporate partners’ nominees). Also, one of the partners must reside in Nigeria and ensure that the partnership complies with the regulations of the CAMA.
4. Private Limited Company
A Private Limited Company is a business structure that operates as a ‘juristic person’, i.e., it can sue and be sued under its registered name. In an Ltd., it is required there must be at least 50 members with a minimum issued share capital of N100,000. 
Additionally, the owners of a PLC are not liable for any act by the company and their liability is limited to their contribution to the memorandum and articles of association. 
This means that their liability is limited to only the number of shares they own. A distinguishing aspect of a PLC is that it operates under a memorandum of association and its shares are private and cannot be traded on the public stock exchange market.

5. Public Limited Company
A Public Limited Company (PLC) is among the types of company that can be registered with the CAC in Nigeria. This business entity is suitable for large companies like banks and its shares are traded publicly on the stock market. 
Additionally, the law requires a PLC to annually publish their financial records for the sake of accountability and transparency. 
This type of corporation must be registered by a minimum of two adults and have an operating share capital of N2,000,000.
6. Company Limited by Guarantee
This type of company can be referred to as a 'non-profit organization' and they are registered not for the aim of earning profits but to promote art, commerce, religion, etc. 
It doesn’t have a share capital and the guarantors don’t claim any profit, thereby having no claim to the company’s assets. 
The liability of the members is limited to the amount they undertake in contribution to the company’s assets. Ultimately, all income the company generates is utilized in covering operational costs and achieving its objectives.
7. Private Unlimited Company
This type of company is a rare type of business registration done in Nigeria in which the shareholders have unlimited personal liability for the obligations and debt of the company. Overall, what this means is that the members have a non-limited and joint responsibility to clear the company’s liabilities.
8. Incorporated Trustees
This entity is not a business organization but a non-governmental organization that consists of one or more trustees appointed by a group of people bound by religion, custom, etc. 
There are no share capital or shareholders but it is run by a board of trustees. Furthermore, Trustees can be a Church, Mosque, Charity organization, etc, and usually have a chairman and secretary managing their affairs.

Company Registration vs Business Name Registration: What is the Difference?
byChidinma Nwonye
Starting your entrepreneurial journey can be exciting and one major legal step in this process is registering your venture with the Corporate Affairs Commission. However, you need to understand what kind of registration to do, be it a business name or a company name.
Contrary to what some business owners think, a business name and a company name are not the same as there are key differences between the two. 
In this article, we’ll explore what a business and company name is and the major differences between the two to help you make informed decisions when registering.
Does a Business / Company Name Matter?
Your business or company name is probably the only thing a potential customer will remember when looking up your brand online or making comparisons. It is your brand’s identity and it goes a long way in boosting customer/ investor loyalty, and brand consistency which leads to long-term revenue growth. 
A business name does wonders for your brand’s growth and knowing the differences that come with the various registration types is vital for every business owner.
What is a Business Name? 
Before we explain what a business name is, let’s see what a business actually is. A business is any activity undertaken to earn profit. It comprises a wide range of operations such as partnerships, sole proprietorships, and corporations, and can vary in legal structure, size, or complexity. 
So basically speaking, those goods or commodities you exchange for profit to other people, or the services you decide to sell online is a business activity. 
Now what is a business name? A business name is the title a venture operates under for commercial purposes and it is also known as an enterprise. The Companies and Allied Matters Act (CAMA) 2020 further defines a business name as a style or name under which businesses are carried on, be it in a partnership or otherwise'
So what does it mean to register a business name? A business name registration is the process of registering your business with the Corporate Affairs Commission (CAC), thus allowing you to legally operate under that name. 
Additionally, once you have successfully registered your business name with the CAC on the Moniepoint Business Banking App, you receive a Certificate of Registration and a Certified Extract of Registration Information, ensuring your business is recognised and compliant. 
Some requirements to register a business name with the CAC include;
2 Preferred business names
Your Business Address
Your Residential Address
The Nature of your business company,
Identification Card, i.e., National Identity Card (NIN), voter's card, or driver's license.

Your email address
What is a Company Name? 
Firstly, a company is comprised of people who come together for the common goal of doing business and earning profit. Once registered, a company is a separate legal entity different from its owners. 
Furthermore, A limited liability company is a type of company that limits the amount of liability or responsibility the owners can personally bear in the case of company debt. It can be a private or public company and can be further divided into ‘limited by shares', ‘limited by guarantee’ or ‘unlimited' depending on their structure. 
To break it down, in the case of 'limited by shares', the owners own shares in the company representing how much of the company they own. Whereas, in 'limited by guarantee', the members’ liabilities are limited to the amount they have decided to contribute to the company’s assets in case of any company bankruptcy. 
Therefore, an individual’s liability for debts incurred by the company is limited to the extent of capital the shareholder contributes or the guarantee offered. 
Now, what is a Company name registration? A Company name registration legally establishes your business as a public or private limited company with the Corporate Affairs Commission (CAC). 
It gives your company its legal identity, separate from its owners. When registering your company, you'll need to provide the following details or documents;
Two preferred names for your company
Company Address
Nature of Business
Residential Address
Memorandum and Articles of Association
Share Allotment
Email
Phone Number
ID Card of Directors
Signature of Directors
Company Name VS. Business Name Registration
Now that you know what a business and a company name are and the requirements for registering both, let's look at their differences.
As a business owner, you can decide to convert your business name to a company name. Some factors that might influence this decision are the need to raise capital, loan processing, acquiring assets, etc. 
Whatever the case may be, ensure that the process is properly done via the CAC portal with the necessary proof and documents. 
Wrapping Up
Understanding the difference between registering a business name and a company name is essential for any budding entrepreneur. 
As much as both terms are used when referring to commercial activities, you should know how they differ concerning legality, taxation, liability protection, and more. 
Thinking of registering your business or company with the CAC on the Moniepoint Business Banking? Ensure to properly analyze your goals and long-term plans as this enables you to make the right choice.

Benefits of Registering Your Business Name with the CAC in Nigeria
1. Legitimacy
The Companies and Allied Matters Act (CAMA) 2020 mandates all businesses in Nigeria to undergo a business name registration. This enables your business to gain a right standing before the law, thereby ensuring that it is a legitimate entity recognised by the government. 
You can save yourself the legal implications of running an unregistered business name and enjoy the benefit of setting up a business bank account under your unique name. Furthermore, as a Moniepoint Business Bank Account Holder, you can register your business name on the Business Banking App and get your certificate of registration within five days.
2. Boosts Your Brand
Running your business with a registered business name creates a unique brand identity for it and enables you to establish trustworthiness and credibility in your industry. Most customers are more comfortable transacting with businesses that are registered as it reassures them of the legitimacy of the business.
3. Increased Access to Loans and Government Grants
Most government loans such as the Federal Grant and Loans initiative are available to businesses with a registered business name. By registering your business name with the CAC, you stand a better chance of accessing such loans, grants, and sometimes investments.
4. Protection
When you register your business name with the CAC, it ensures legal protection for your business against infringement or duplication by other businesses. Once you’ve registered your business name, it becomes protected by the law, that is, no other business can operate using that business name. 
Ultimately, this aids you in avoiding legal issues and complications, thus protecting your brand reputation.
5. A Unique Business Bank Account
As a business owner, making transactions using a business bank account like Moniepoint MFB set up in your business name is beneficial. Customers, for instance, prefer sending money to an identifiable brand name rather than a personal bank account. From improving customer loyalty to ensuring smooth business funds operations separate from your personal funds, the Moniepoint Business Banking App offers various banking benefits. 
Conclusion
Nothing sounds better than a smooth-running business safe from the hitches of legal complications. By registering your business name, you get to enjoy a unique business bank account as well as the loyalty and opportunities that come with your business’s legitimacy.

From Pakistan to the world: my multicultural career adventure 
byAbdul Mateen
Hey there!  Picture this: a guy from Pakistan, born and raised, suddenly finds himself working with people from all over the world. Sounds exciting, right? Well, it was, but also a bit of a rollercoaster!
Imagine walking into a meeting and being expected to call your boss by their first name. In Pakistan, that’s like calling your school principal 'dude.' Total cultural shock! But guess what? I’ve learned to roll with these quirks, and they’ve made me a better professional and a more adaptable person.
Wondering how I found myself at Moniepoint? Let’s take it back a bit. 
Growing up in Pakistan 
I was born in a city near Lahore in Pakistan, but I have been working from Lahore for the last 10 years. Lahore is a major city in Pakistan but not the capital. It stands tall in the education and IT sector. 
I started my career in engineering in high school and then moved to computer science. In 2010, I started my Bachelor of Science (BS) in software engineering. This career path was not trendy then, but after a couple of years, tech-related courses became common. Although I got into this path by chance, it has proved to be a good choice. 
In Pakistan, we have a joint family culture where elders influence the children's career and education choices. I’m happy that my family agreed with my choices back then. This culture also extends to respecting elders and being obedient, and this applies to our professional careers. Whenever we call someone by their first or last name, we have to add words that show respect. 
It was a culture shock for me when I started working with multinational companies, and we called people by their first names. So, I would rather use words like sir or the boss. But it’s been about nine years in this industry, and I have worked with many international clients in the US and Canada, and now I’m working with a mix of nationalities. I had to adjust over time, but now I’m comfortable with others calling me Abdul.
Currently in Pakistan, the culture of calling people by their first names has gradually become adopted, at least in the tech sector. 

Getting started in the tech industry
I started my career as a software developer in 2015. I worked as a Java developer with a Canada-based software company, for about six years. While there, I got a feel for what it felt like to work with an international company in a different time zone. Working hours are usually from 9 am to 5 pm, but as someone living in Pakistan, this meant I was to work from 1 p.m. to 10 p.m. It was quite weird at first, but I got used to it after a few months. 
Then, I moved to another company, a Pakistani company with headquarters in the US. So again, I had to work with different clients that were mostly US-based. For this company, I worked from 12 noon to 9 pm Pakistan time. Here, I worked on projects in the e-commerce and fintech industries. I spent about seven years with these companies. 
Getting into Moniepoint 
While I was working with my last company, I received a message from a Moniepoint recruiter on LinkedIn. I initially ignored the message, but it was when it came the second time that I decided to give it a try. 
You must be wondering why I initially ignored the message from the recruiter…
At the time the message came, I was not looking for a new role or opportunity as I was quite happy with my current role and organisation. Also, I had never heard about Moniepoint (then TeamApt). However, when the recruiter reached out again, I had to do my research and look into the company’s profile.
I was a bit hesitant as I didn’t know any Pakistani who was working for Moniepoint then. There is also the fact that I had worked for US and European regions and clients, but never African. This was going to be new waters, and I was not sure about the time zone as well.  By the second message, I said to myself, let’s give it a try. And here I am.
In the time since I joined, we’ve had a lot of people from India, Pakistan, and other parts of the world join the team, and it’s been interesting getting to interact with all these different people.
What I love about Moniepoint 
When I joined Moniepoint, I realised that I was wrong about It. I was expecting that it would be a strict culture without compromises and that there would be a huge cultural difference. But the contrary was the case.
The onboarding process was very smooth, and the HR team was very receptive. My entire team was also welcoming. In a month, I became a super fan of Moniepoint because of its culture, flexibility, and respect for its employees. 
I love that there is No Ego at all within Moniepoint. As I mentioned earlier, I come from a culture where we used to give respect to elders, and we would call our superiors boss or sir. But here, respect was from top to bottom as well. Line managers never gave us a situation where we had to make them feel like bosses. You can enjoy working with a good team where everyone has a great sense of humour, and mutual respect for one another.
Work-Life Balance 
Remember when I talked about flexibility? It is something I really enjoy about working at Moniepoint. At Moniepoint, I work as a senior backend engineer. In my role, I design and develop APIs based on requirements, write database migration scripts, and perform code reviews whenever required. I also write unit tests for the code, and update API collections and assist QA in testing. 
My typical day starts at noon in Pakistan, allowing me to do personal stuff in the morning. I start my day by looking at ema
ils for meetings and messages. I also look at my sticky notes to see if anything is pending from the previous work day that I didn’t achieve. I then attend standup with my team and do lots of follow-ups and testing. If anything comes up, I could also have a couple of sync-ups. I sign out at 9 pm, but I would also stay available on work chat in case anything comes up. 
I love that there is the flexibility of having some free hours in the morning before I get to work. I also enjoy the perks of working with a supportive team where the workload is shared and everyone lends support when needed. On a scale of 1 to 10, I would rate my job satisfaction at Moniepoint at a 9 just so there would be room for improvement. But seriously, it’s 10/10.
When I’m off work.. 
Pakistan has all types of weather: plain fields, deserts, mountains, rivers, and seas. But for most of it, it’s usually hot weather throughout the year.  When off work, I recommend spending time in the mountain areas. Fun fact: 30% of Pakistan's areas are covered with mountains. These areas are beautiful and a sight for the eyes! 
We have Kashmir, Naran Kagan, Babusar Top, Gilgit, Chitral, Sawat, etc. These are hilly areas full of nature, trees, snow, and beauty. 

I enjoy working at Moniepoint, and I bet you would too! Looking for a new opportunity? Don’t be shy. Put your best foot into applying to the roles on our careers page. Moniepoint is a great company with the latest tech stack and the best of the best work culture.

FG lauds Moniepoint’s contributions to the growth of the informal economy
byBemigho Awala
Vice President of the Federal Republic of Nigeria, Senator Kashim Shettima, has restated the government’s unvarnished commitment to deepening economic and financial inclusion in line with President Bola Tinubu's Renewed Hope Agenda, noting that financial inclusion is a core component and the government is making a lot of efforts to ensure that the vulnerable in society have safety nets as exemplified by the ASO accord which was signed this year.  
He made these comments over the weekend at the Abuja Continental Hotel in Abuja while speaking as principal guest of honour at the launch of the 2024 Nigeria Informal Economy Report powered by Moniepoint in collaboration with the Small and Medium Enterprise Development Agency of Nigeria, SMEDAN and the Federal Ministry of Industry, Trade, and Investment. 
The Nigeria's Informal Economy Report offers fresh insights for individuals and organizations interested in understanding the dynamics of Nigeria's informal economy and shaping a more inclusive and sustainable economic landscape. Some of the key insights from the report include:
The youthful demographic is a critical driving force of Nigeria's informal economy, with over 57.7% of business owners under 34 years old
There is an untapped earning potential that is prevalent in the informal segment, with the average monthly income below ₦250,000 while on the higher end of the spectrum, only about 1.3% of businesses in Nigeria’s informal economy earn above N2.5 million monthly
Retail and General Trade is the leading industry within the informal economy, making up 24% of all informal businesses
The reality that unemployment is the primary driver for starting a business by many players in the informal sector
Sen Shettima, represented by the Technical Adviser to the President on Economic & Financial Inclusion, Dr. Nurudeen Abubakar Zauro, acknowledged and appreciated the role of players in the informal space, especially Moniepoint. 'We can all remember during the Covid-19 lockdown and the recent currency changes, there were a lot of challenges and we saw agencies like this come together and save the country at that point. This is because of the flexible initiatives they brought into the space, especially last-mile delivery by providing a platform that allowed people to successfully transact. SMEDAN's innovative streak has also been very commendable, he said.  
In his opening remarks, Managing Director, Moniepoint Microfinance Bank, Babatunde Olofin, praised operators of informal businesses for the high degree of flexibility and innovation they exhibit in adapting quickly to changing market conditions. Highlighting their economic significance, he said that the informal economy contributes substantially to Nigeria's GDP and can be effectively mobilized to unleash Nigeria’s full economic potential and provide much needed support to the most vulnerable households in our society.
Minister of Industry, Trade and Investment, Dr. Doris Uzoka-Anite, who formally launched the report, reiterated the Federal Government’s commitment to supporting small business operators in the informal sector of the economy. She pointed out that the informal sector, which often appears to be forgotten, would henceforth begin to enjoy government’s interventions and incentives.
She said: 'We are really grateful to Moniepoint for conducting this report. It gives us the basis and foundation now to provide targeted intervention as part of the government’s approach to supporting the informal economy. This segment plays a significant role in the Nigerian economy, we can now bring them up to enjoy incentives that the government is providing to the broader economy as well.
Also delivering a goodwill message, the Chairman, House Committee on Small and Medium Enterprises (SMEs), Hon. Mansur Manu Soro, said the House was taking deliberate steps to prioritize women operating in the informal sector and end gender disparity in earnings. He expressed the National Assembly’s commitment to give the report its full attention, subjecting it to the necessary review and internalizing it while lauding Moniepoint for its positive impact in pushing financial inclusion. 
'I want to congratulate Moniepoint for achieving such a national penetration as far as the banking industry is concerned within a very short period of time. The story of Moniepoint is the story of how technology can propel a business to unprecedented levels within a short time span. Reports like this one which we’d be releasing today remain a critical tool used in planning by the government and private sector and we in the House of Reps will be internalizing it legislatively.' 
Chief Executive Officer, Moniepoint Inc, Tosin Eniolorunda in his foreword provided the rationale for the report, 'In just a few years, over 2 million businesses, many within the informal economy, have chosen Moniepoint as their essential growth partner. The commitment we feel to this sector inspired the creation of this report. By quantifying the informal economy's impacts and nuances, we can better shape policies and programs to empower and uplift the entrepreneurs driving it forward. Their success is inextricably linked to Nigeria's continued growth and development.' 
In a keynote presentation, Director General/CEO SMEDAN, Charles Odii, said that small businesses are the engine of the Nigerian economy and most of Nigeria’s approximately 40 million small businesses reside in the informal sector. He noted that these businesses which are born of both necessity and entrepreneurial zeal, exemplify the famous Nigerian ‘hustling’ while affirming that the agency is working to formalize these businesses and bring them into the formal sector to increase access to important resources such as finance.
'Ensuring their survival and catalyzing their growth is crucial for poverty elimination, rural industrialization, and the enhancement of livelihoods, all three core mandates of SMEDAN. Their formalization will aid the development of brand value and financial history, which indicates creditworthiness and attracts investment.'
Furthermore, Odii articulated SMEDAN’s agenda aimed at accelerating growth and prosperity for small businesses as encapsulated in the acronym ‘GROW’: Guidance, Resources, Opportunities, and Workforce support. According to him, the agency’s focus spans seven priority sectors including agriculture (EAT Nigeria), manufacturing (PRODUCE Nigeria), tourism (VISIT Nigeria), fashion (WEAR Nigeria), creative industries (WATCH AND LISTEN Nigeria), education (TEACH Nigeria), and services (PATRONISE Nigeria). This agenda focuses on expanding local production capacities, improving market access both domestically and internationally, and creating an enabling environment for over 40 million small businesses, collectively providing more than 60 million jobs.
The event featured a panel session which was moderated by Vice President, Corporate Affairs, Moniepoint Inc, Didi Uwemakpan with the theme: Building an inclusive and sustainable informal economy for Nigeria: Hopes and Impediments. The panelists which included Special Adviser to the President on Economic Affairs, Dr. Tope Fasua; Head, Financial Inclusion Delivery Unit, Central Bank of Nigeria, Dr Paul Oluikpe; DG, SMEDAN; Founder, She Forum Africa, Inimfon Etuk and MD, Moniepoint Microfinance Bank were unanimous and strident in the call for continued collaboration and concerted efforts to support and elevate Nigeria’s vibrant informal economy towards sustainable growth and development. 
Some of the dignitaries who attended the event include Senior Special Assistant to the President on Entrepreneurship in Innovation & Digital Economy, Engr Jennifer Adighije; National President, Nigerian Association of Chambers of Commerce, Industry, Mines, and Agriculture (NACCIMA), Barr. Dele Kelvin Oye; MD/CEO, Abuja Enterprise Agency, Mr. Chudi Ugwuada-Ezirigwe; Registrar General/CEO, Corporate Affairs Commission, Hussaini Ishaq Magaji, SAN, among others.

Moniepoint, SMEDAN set to launch Nigeria’s Informal Economy Report in Abuja  
byBemigho Awala
Africa’s fastest growing financial institution according to the Financial Times, Moniepoint MfB in conjunction with the Ministry of Industry, Trade, and Investment, and Small and Medium Enterprise Development Agency of Nigeria, SMEDAN  is set for the launch of Nigeria's Informal Economy Report 2024 holding in Abuja on the 5th of July 2024 at the Abuja Continental Hotel. 
Speaking on the impending launch, Babatunde Olofin, the bank's managing director said 'the report signposts Moniepoint's commitment to deepening the resource pool for policy makers in Nigeria and the financial ecosystem stakeholders, by providing a fresh and holistic viewpoint and critical analysis on accessing the informal economy, opportunities for growth and vivid portraits of the informal sector players as well. 
Nigeria's informal economy plays a crucial role in the nation's economic landscape. Its importance is signposted by the employment opportunities it provides for a significant portion of the Nigerian population, particularly for those who may not have access to formal employment. This space also serves as a primary source of income for many households, contributing to poverty alleviation.
According to Director General/CEO SMEDAN, Charles Odii, 'Nigeria's approximately 40 million small businesses that reside in the informal sector are born of both necessity and entrepreneurial zeal, they exemplify the famous 'hustling' spirit that unites Nigerians across social divides and is responsible for the employment of millions. Ensuring their survival and catalyzing their growth is crucial for poverty elimination, rural industrialization, and the enhancement of livelihoods, all three core mandates of SMEDAN.'
Some of the dignitaries expected at the event are Vice President, Federal Republic of Nigeria, Alhaji Kashim Shettima, GCON, Hon Minister of Industry, Trade and Investment, Hon (Dr) Doris Nkiruka Uzoka-Anite, Registrar General/CEO, Corporate Affairs Commission, Hussaini Ishaq Magaji, SAN, Special Adviser on Economic Affairs, Office of the Vice President, Dr Tope Fasua, SSA to the President on Entrepreneurship in Innovation & Digital Economy, Jennifer Adighije, House Committee Chairman on Small and Medium Scale Enterprises (SMEs), Hon. Mansur Manu Soro among others. 
The Nigeria's Informal Economy Report has been curated as a must-read for individuals and organizations interested in understanding the dynamics of Nigeria's informal economy and shaping a more inclusive and sustainable economic landscape. The Moniepoint brand has long championed the importance of financial inclusion and financial happiness even as improving business and consumer access to the financial system is core to Moniepoint’s philosophy. 
Industry experts have averred that this collaborative exercise between Moniepoint, SMEDAN and the Ministry of Industry, Trade, and Investment represents an important milestone that will catalyze Nigeria's informal economy while giving a huge boost to the Renewed Hope Agenda of President Bola Ahmed Tinubu as all stakeholders continue to show resolve in helping the informal economy thrive and surpass its current contributions to Nigeria’s economic aspirations.

RIPPLES: How Wole uses IRIS to empower internal teams 
byChidinma Enemanna
When you hear IRIS, what comes to mind? You may be like me, who initially got confused the first time I encountered the ‘IRIS’ team. I wondered if we had now become an optical organisation. Digging further, I realised that IRIS stood for Internal Reconciliation and Internal Settlement, and I decided to have a quick chat with the VP of the IRIS team to learn more about what the team does. 
Fun fact: Wole, the VP of this team, loves to solve mathematics over the weekend! Curious to learn more about Wole and the IRIS team? Here’s my conversation with him. 
Hi Wole. IRIS???
Hi Chidinma. Yes, I know it’s an interesting name. When we were trying to build this product, we wanted a short, unique, and catchy name. We were just talking about what the product does, and that’s when it hit… IRIS! What does the product do? It is our internal reconciliation and settlement tool. So, IRIS—Internal Reconciliation and Internal Settlement!
As VP Settlement, Reconciliation and Accounting Tools, describe your role and daily activities?
My primary role involves building systems to ensure that the operations and finance teams have what they need to do their jobs.  This basically means providing them with tools, products, integrations, and even third-party solutions to ensure that finance can do what it needs to do. An example would be instead of going out to get a settlement and reconciliation solution, we built one in-house.
In my function, I have engineers, TPMs, and a product manager who report to me. We have that structure which allows us to build solutions that are tailor-made for all our problems. In terms of settlement and reconciliation, our structure ensures that we settle our transactions appropriately, and we can reconcile our transactions by understanding the complexities and nuances of our own organisation and our multiple business lines. 
The other part is accounting tools. There's a solution called IRIS, which is a backronym(we created the acronym after we got the name). It stands for internal reconciliation and internal settlement tool. So, it was just a cool name at the time to show that we have 'visibility' on all transactions. Still sticking with the eye theme, our other solution is Retina. While IRIS is used by the settlement and reconciliation team, and sometimes even by the finance team, Retina is used just for the finance function to view transactions. We’re building a newer product. 
So, my role is a product role. Daily, I have to serve as an account manager and information system specialist or support the finance function. In doing this, I get to decide what the strategy and road map would be and what we should focus on.  Also, I work closely with the SVPs of the various units to decide what solutions to build and that we have our numbers where they should be. My day-to-day could go from preparing reports to building dashboards,  writing product documentation and Python scripts, or sometimes just debugging issues and trying to understand why certain legacy things are working the way they are.  Some days, I’m looking through reports; others, I run through meetings.  
What are your department's three key objectives? 
Objective one would be to ensure on-time settlements of all transactions involving settlement reports and statements and timeliness, and we have KPIs that we use to measure that. The settlement should not be behind if it’s not a weekend or public holiday. This means we should have a representative position that does not exceed one day; we should not be more than one day behind in our settlement reports. If it’s a weekend or public holiday, it could lead to it being more days. 
Another objective would be moving all our accounts to daily reconciliation, which means we should be able to reconcile all the transactions that happened yesterday and understand the exceptions. It also means that the age of items in various accounts doesn’t exceed a maximum of two days, even with the logistics of public holidays and weekends.  
The third objective is to ensure that finance has everything it needs for its financial reporting and can carry out its transactions without the need for hard work or more solutions. Our integration with Netsuite ensures that finance has the financial and regulatory reporting unlocked. This means they can simply download those reports or use the report builder to build custom reports.
How does IRIS  improve day-to-day operations for employees within the company?
The IRIS solution we provide ensures that settlement can happen in real time. This means you can sign in and carry out the settlement of transactions; it is an internal representation of all our transactions that have been outside. 
It is our internal reconciliation and settlement tool at Moniepoint that helps connect all the information sitting in all the other core banking applications by using the bank statement that we get from our settlement banks to give us all our external positions. 
For example, Chidinma goes to a store that uses a Moniepoint terminal, and carries out her transaction from any of her bank accounts, even if it were a Moniepoint bank account. So, that transaction will happen, and we will probably receive the money in our bank account outside. If we receive the money in one of our settlement banks, there’s no way to connect the bank’s CBA to our own CBA. So, IRIS serves as a bridge that connects all the information sitting in all the other core banking applications by using the bank statement that we get from those banks to give us all our external positions. 
This way, the finance team knows where we stand from a cash position. They get to see how much cash we have, the receivable position, how much people owe us, how much we owe people, our income, how much expense we’ve incurred carrying out transactions, etc. So, IRIS will be able to integrate all that information by serving as a de facto bridge. We make life easier for most internal teams as we optimise processes.  
Alrighty. Let’s get a bit more personal now. So, VP… how do you approach leadership and team management? 
So, my approach to leadership is the NO EGO approach. Sometimes, I go into meetings and understand what needs to be built, but I can’t dictate how it should be built. I am open to learning from people I work with; this helps challenge them and even myself. By listening to others, I get to learn new things, and we do not just build in one direction. 
Although No Ego is the core value I embody the body, I think I also use a combination of all of Moniepoint’s core values in my leadership style. However, I will pick No Ego and Grit as I will do whatever it takes to get the job done. 
To my final question, what’s something you absolutely enjoy doing that most people would consider crazy?
One thing about me is that I enjoy taking risks. I have jumped out of an airplane, done skydiving, drifted on a quad bike, etc. During the weekend, you will probably see me solving mathematics. 
Wole uses his job function to empower internal teams within Moniepoint. You, too, can do great work and power dreams by heading to our right away!careers page

Living in Asia, Powering Dreams in Africa
byAparana Bhatt
Being part of an international community is a beautiful part of my work as an Engineer at moniepoint! I love interacting with multiple nationalities in the same virtual space, and it has had a huge impact on my personal development. I collaborate and interact with people, which has influenced how I even approach my work as an Engineer, as I understand building tech from different perspectives. Unlike my previous work experiences, I was working with a homogenous group. Here, I get to work with people from Nigeria, Greece, the UK, etc.
Why am I going on and on about the international community?
My name is Aparana Bhatt, and I live in India. I work at Moniepoint as a Senior Backend Engineer. When people ask me how I cope with the time zone differences, I smile because it’s perfect for me. I am not a morning person. I prefer to sleep in and stay up late. With our time zone difference, I get to start work around noon, and it just gives me the flexibility to sleep to my satisfaction while still having a bit of time to spend with family before getting into the heat of work. Before I talk about how I started working at Moniepoint, I think I’d like to begin with my education and interest in backend engineering.
Where it all began
I have always loved engineering. In India, our parents have a lot of say in what we study, and most parents want us to study something in the sciences, law or business. As a child, I always loved science and maths, so I think that made my parents confident in my choice and not have to insist on anything. So, when I had to pick three top choices, I chose computer science, electrical engineering and electronics engineering, but I got assigned computer science and engineering. So that's how my journey began. Initially, during my college education, I didn’t enjoy it so much because I had been more of an electronics person, but later on, especially during my first job, my interest grew. 
I studied computer science and engineering and graduated from Harcourt Butler Technological Institute in 2015. If you’re unfamiliar with India, this institute is primarily located in Kanpur, Uttar Pradesh, India. It is around 100 years old now, and was one of the first colleges providing engineering degrees since 1928 or something.
After school, I started working. My first job as a software developer was at a travel organisation. I was in the backend team, handling everything Java-related. And I worked there for two and a half years. Seeing the impact one could make through software engineering was what did it for me. 
After that, I worked for an Indian media company. There, I worked for around four years. My team was focused on providing super fast news to the editors, processing it, and publishing it in our digital news platform. By the second year of working there, I had developed a bit of interest in Data Science. Taking this interest further, I got a degree in Data Science while I was still working. After, I joined another company as a technical lead. Here, we focused on lending and offering credit so that customers could buy what they needed. As technical lead, my day-to-day work was still backend-related, but I was a part of different projects. After working here for a while, I decided to take a break. 
The break between the journey to Powering Dreams
Firstly, I had taken this break for about four months to refresh and recharge. At that point, I was homesick because I had to live in Delhi and Sia most of my career to work from the office in my previous roles. During the break, I wasn’t even so big on travelling, but I did travel a bit and spent most of the break in my home town with my family. The difference between living with my family was so evident that I decided I wouldn’t be taking any job that required me to be away from home. And, like I said earlier, it’s one of the things that made me interested in working with Moniepoint.
Moniepoint
By the time I was taking a break from my break, I had decided that I wanted a job that kept me close to home and gave me a semblance of the peace I had experienced during my break. Around that time, one of our recruiters contacted me for a Technical Product Manager role I interviewed for, but I didn’t make it through. The interview experience, however, piqued my interest in Moniepoint. I went to the website, read almost all the employee stories, and was impressed. I could see the company making an evidential impact in emerging markets, but it was beyond that for me. I could also see that the working conditions were what I was looking for. So I went to the careers page and saw an opening for senior backend engineering, which I applied for. 
Why Moniepoint?
For me, Moniepoint’s impact resonated strongly because comparing Nigeria to India, we have a lot in common regarding financial inclusion, and the huge impact Moniepoint has had in the lives of regular, everyday people sold it for me.
From August, when I had my interview for a TPM role, until November, when I saw an opening for a senior backend engineer, I’d go to the website fortnightly to read the stories of employees and other articles about the company. The impact of Moniepoint was and is quite visible. Even the impact on employees, not just customers, caught my attention. 
Also, following the progress of the products, I could see a consistent effort to improve, basically being committed to finding ways to create financial happiness via digitisation. And oh, the timing for me - it’s the best timing that any organisation can give me, jokes apart. To know that I get to spend with their family and everything in a remote setup, like even if the hours are hectic, you are still close to your family. That’s a huge selling point for me.
Powering Dreams in an International Community
I’ve been here for about 6 months now, and my expectations have been exceeded. When I initially joined, I was on the savings team. Abraham was my Enterprise Architect, and I worked with him, Vincent and Tolu, amongst others. I noticed the speed at which we were able to resolve customer issues. The time an issue was raised was never an issue. All that mattered was for all hands to be on deck and for it to be resolved as soon as it was raised. Seeing this, I was more confident that I had made the right choice to join here as it further proved that we are customer-centric, not just product-centric, in our approach.
But if I were asked what I love the most about working here, it wouldn’t just be about the impact. It's also about being in such a diverse community of people, like I mentioned earlier. As I’m learning a lot about other people’s cultures, they are learning a lot about mine. So I think this is a sharing process I like a lot. Also, everybody I have worked with has been very understanding and helpful in a way that helps me stay motivated to do my work at my best.
Enough work talk. Here’s how I have fun.
For a job that is this flexible, I’d be wasteful only to spend time working. So when I'm not working, I try to relax in different ways. Recently, I joined swimming classes and had a good time in them. Otherwise, I sketch, paint, or just go for long drives. Once or twice a month, I go on a road trip. Recently, I took a road trip to Ranikhet - a small hilly village in India. And, of course, these trips do not affect my work because I can set up anywhere and work as long as I’m hitting my performance requirements. 
Now, enough about me, what about you? 
I know when I was waiting for a role that fits my next career path, I spent a lot of time reading stories on the blog, so I am guessing you’re here because you’re considering or wondering if you should consider joining Moniepoint. Here’s the simple truth I’d tell you -  it's worth giving a try. If you live in India or somewhere outside Nigeria, I think it’s the best option for you because, aside from the flexibility, you get to be part of an international community,  interacting with people from different cultures around the world. I’d give you a thumbs up. Just check for a role that fits.  https://moniepoint.com/careers

World MSME Day: Moniepoint celebrates MSMEs as the backbone of global economies and SDG champions 
byBemigho Awala
From economic downturns to global crises, Micro, Small, and Medium-sized Enterprises, MSMEs have continued to demonstrate remarkable resilience and adaptability, in facilitating economic growth and development across borders. 
Driven by the increased need to improve access to financial services to power sustained and inclusive progress, Africa’s fastest-growing financial institution according to the Financial Times, Moniepoint MFB has reiterated its commitment to providing peerless and holistic support for, MSMEs in order to boost their capacity to achieve the Sustainable Development Goals, while promoting innovation, creativity, and sustainable business practices across the country.
According to the United Nations, MSMEs account for over 90% of businesses and 60-70% of employment worldwide. These enterprises make up 50% of global GDP. They contribute to the global economy and sustain livelihoods, particularly among the working poor, youth, women, and workers in vulnerable situations. It will be recalled that following a resolution adopted by the UN General Assembly in April 2017, 27th of June was designated as 'Micro-, Small, and Medium-sized Enterprises Day' to raise awareness of the tremendous contributions of MSMEs to the achievement of the United Nations Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs).
Speaking on the commemoration of this year’s World MSME Day, Managing Director, Moniepoint MFB, Babatunde Olofin noted that MSMEs can lead the charge toward a sustainable and prosperous future with the proper support from governments, financial institutions, and consumers at large while explaining that enablers like Moniepoint is willing to partner with all stakeholders to can create an environment that supports MSMEs in their efforts to invest, trade, and thrive in local and global markets, harnessing the attendant developmental benefits. 
'We recognize that MSMEs are the lifeblood of the Nigerian economy. Millions of people depend on them every day for food, daily necessities, and sustenance. For businesses across Nigeria, we have just one promise - we’re always going to be here to make you happy. As we celebrate this year’s World MSME Day, we must all acknowledge the hard work, dedication, and perseverance of MSMEs and the driving the charge to not only bolster economic stability but also foster sustainable development, helping to eradicate poverty and improve the quality of life for  Nigerians,' Olofin said. 
He continued, 'on a day like this, we must renew our commitment to join hands - agencies of government, private sector operators, and all stakeholders - to continue supporting MSMEs through policies, funding, and capacity-building initiatives. By empowering MSMEs, we pave the way for a more sustainable, inclusive, and prosperous future for all, especially the coming generations.'
Moniepoint MFB has been widely recognized for its innovative efforts at giving small businesses access to digital financial services, including the ability to accept payments, access working capital loans and manage their finances, which helps them to increase productivity, serve customers better, and ultimately to grow. 
In a bid to look out and champion the survival of small businesses even as the world celebrates MSMES, the financial services powerhouse recently provided incentives to some business owners across Nigeria to ensure the lights are kept on. Gift vouchers ranging from 3 months worth of inventory restock for a general retail services provider to two months worth of sewing material to a tailor even as a food & drinks supplier received a fuel voucher in order to solve his logistics needs amongst other recipients. The beneficiaries who expressed their gratitude to Moniepoint noted that the gesture would go a long way to boost their productivity and ensure that they can better serve their local communities. 
As the sector closest to local communities, MSMEs are essential for creating local jobs, empowering women, youth, persons with disabilities and other groups in vulnerable situations. Commemorating MSME Day is a recognition that this vital sector, who are the agents of innovation, growth, and sustainability, at the heart of our societies has tremendous potential to unlock critical pathways to accelerate SDG progress across the globe.

Africa's premier MMA championship gets a big boost as Moniepoint powers Kamaru Usman’s AKO series 
byBemigho Awala
Africa’s fastest growing financial institution, according to the Financial Times, Moniepoint Inc. has thrown its heavy weight to support the growth and development of the Mixed Martial Arts, MMA across the continent. 
This is signposted by a season-long partnership with the promoters of African Knockout Championship, Africa’s pioneering MMA promotion, which features the amateur MMA reality TV production 'The AKO Show,' and a series of professional MMA fight nights branded 'Face Off.' 
The partnership, which embodies the shared values of grit and powering dreams, which are at the core of both Moniepoint's mission and the spirit of MMA, comes at a time when the sport even though dogged by a lack of fight tournaments and sufficient talent is gaining significant traction in Africa, with 19 countries having recognised it as a national sport. 
Mixed Martial Arts, also known as cage fighting, is a full-contact compact sport that incorporates elements from various combat sports and is based on striking, grappling & ground fighting. Africans leading the charge include Usman 'Nigerian Nightmare' Kamaru, the first African-born champion in the UFC welterweight division, Israel 'The Last Stylebender' Adesanya, another champion in the middleweight category, and Cameroonian Francis Ngannou, a heavyweight champion have been very instrumental to the popularity of the sport such that it’s been dubbed the fastest-growing sport on Earth, measured in participation and audience.
Speaking to the rationale behind Moniepoint’s sponsorship of African Knockout Championship (AKO4), which is set to make history with its first live event in Abuja on Saturday, June 15th at the Abuja Continental Hotel, Group Chief Executive Officer, Moniepoint Inc, Tosin Eniolorunda noted that the financial powerhouse is buoyed by the opportunity that the platform provides to power the dreams of young MMA fighters and showcase their grit and fighting prowess to the world. 
'As humans, the quest to fight is in our DNA, and progressively, society has moved forward when we fight and surmount challenges and obstacles. We are excited to partner with AKO to support the rapid growth of MMA in Africa. This collaboration aligns perfectly with our commitment to powering dreams, fostering resilience and demonstrating guts and grit. Together, we will create opportunities for athletes, fans, and businesses in the MMA ecosystem to thrive, flourish and boost a growing subculture across the continent.' 
Eniolorunda continues, 'At the intersection of finance and sport, we see a powerful opportunity to uplift Africa. Our solutions have been critical to breaking down barriers in the financial services industry and deepening inclusion, much like how Mixed Martial Arts breaks down barriers between fighting disciplines. This partnership to develop MMA across the continent is an eloquent statement about African potential and innovation.'
With playoff spots up for grabs, the AKO Championship 4 event, which features 10 African countries, will showcase about nine thrilling bouts across various divisions, including featherweight, middleweight, lightweight, and women’s bantamweight, with the headline fight between Nigeria’s own knockout athlete, Daniel Emeka and Congolese division standout, Flex Munwe. In the women's bantamweight division, a Nigerian sensation who's looking for her second win and a playoff spot, Jane Osigwe will square up with Beninosie grappler, Jibidar Cythia. 
Commenting on the upcoming event, UFC legend and AKO co-owner Kamaru Usman expressed his excitement, saying, 'I am thrilled to see the growth of AKO and the talent that will be on display at AKO4. This event marks a significant milestone for African MMA and I am confident that the fighters will deliver an unforgettable show for the fans.'
With this Moniepoint and AKO partnership, MMA is set to be elevated as a major sport in Africa, offering a platform for young talents to shine on the global stage while providing fans with a unique and electrifying viewing experience as the battle for survival, progression and supremacy comes to the fore.

Moniepoint resumes onboarding; set to enrich millions of Nigerians with new personal banking referral programme
byBemigho Awala
Moniepoint MFB, Africa’s fastest-growing financial institution according to the Financial Times, has relaunched its personal banking referral program to enrich its customers as they enjoy the Moniepoint experience with family and friends.
The referral program is designed to reward users every time their friends or family perform a transaction on Moniepoint after signing up with their referral link. Through this, millions of people will earn well over N100,000 from referrals alone. 
Moniepoint’s technology has powered over 3 million businesses across Nigeria, and with its reliable infrastructure now in the hands of personal users, it now enables seamless payments for many across the country. With referrals linked to transfers, a leading payment method for many in Nigeria, this referral program will provide extra income for many of its users.
Commenting on this development, Babatunde Olofin, Managing Director of Moniepoint MfB, noted that the customer-centric referral program supports the bank's focus on driving financial inclusion while helping to accelerate its vision of creating a society where everyone experiences financial happiness.  
'We know how important seamless financial transactions are, and we’ve seen first-hand the power of peer to peer recommendations and how word-of-mouth referrals can grow a customer base and increase revenue. Given our strong customer obsession and the strings of commendations which we have received that validate the work we do in providing peerless financial services, we want to provide our customers with rewards even as they continue to share these positive experiences with the Moniepoint brand,' Olofin said.
Each current and new personal account holder has been provided with a unique referral code which is identical to their account username and is visible in the Referral Section on the Personal Banking app. This code/link can be shared with anyone, who, upon signing up and transacting with the Moniepoint Personal Banking app, will contribute to rewards for the referrer. 
For every outward interbank transaction conducted by referred customers in the next 12 months, participants will receive a commission. This transparent and straightforward incentive structure ensures that participants reap tangible benefits for actively promoting the Moniepoint Personal Banking app. Referrers can also track the total earnings and referral history from their referral in the 'Earn from Referrals' icon in the app while earnings can be transferred to the user's main account once a minimum of N50 has been earned.
Moniepoint MFB has worked with the Central Bank of Nigeria to strengthen the security of the banking industry in the past month, pausing its onboarding. It has now resumed signing up users with a commitment to providing its users with a secure, convenient and rewarding financial experience. The referral program is just one of the many ways the company is innovating to empower Nigerians and make financial services more accessible. 
It will be recalled that Moniepoint MFB has in the last few months demonstrated peerless commitment to customer focus and satisfaction as evidenced by the opening of its Lekki Admiralty Road office, as well as the roll out of a USSD code, *5573# which offer users a fast, secure, and user-friendly platform to conduct their banking activities with ease. 
According to media reports, Moniepoint Inc. currently processes the majority of the Point of Sales (POS) transactions in Nigeria through its subsidiaries, processing over $182 billion in annualized TPV and as a profitable enterprise, it is Africa’s largest fintech by transaction volume.

#WhatIDo: A day in the life of an Integration Support Engineer
bySeye Folajimi
A few months ago, I led an integration project with a Telco, enabling seamless payment transactions through our POS terminals. This partnership allows Telco customers to make deposits and withdrawals effortlessly. Through this integration, the telco can receive payments and process customer withdrawals via Moniepoint POS Terminal.
Leading that Integration with my Manager was so exciting for me! It meant that their customers could go to the Moniepoint POS terminal to deposit cash. They could just provide their unique reference with the telco, usually their phone number, and then pay the amount they want to deposit. The money would then be deposited into their account instantaneously.
If that sounds exciting, you might be interested in joining my team at Moniepoint. Keep reading to learn more about what I do.
Being an integration support engineer 
As an integration engineer at Moniepoint in the Monnify team, I work very closely with our clients and partners on the Monnify side of the company to understand their requirements, develop and implement integration solutions, and sometimes create new adjacent solutions for the merchant's use-case scenario.
These solutions are mainly offline payments, like offline collections, for example. With that solution, a Monnify merchant can receive payments from a Moniepoint POS. So people can go to a POS and deposit to you or withdraw using Monnify.
We are focused on driving the adoption of payment collection via POS for people who own Monnify accounts. So, my work plays a crucial role in the seamless connection and interaction of systems, software, and technologies between the Monnify solution and Moniepoint.
I work with our clients to understand their ongoing support needs and ensure everything runs smoothly. My day-to-day tasks involve coding, testing integrations, troubleshooting issues, jumping on calls, and communicating with internal and external teams, including the sales team.
Becoming an integration support engineer
It’s funny how I stumbled upon integration support engineering. Transitioning from consulting, I sought a role that combined technical skills with product management and sales insights.
I saw the requirements, skills, and job expectations of an integration engineer, and it was the right fit for me. I could interact with customers and solve their technical problems in a very hands-on way.
You also have to be willing to listen and understand the problem because people have different use cases for the products. So you can advise them on the best way to integrate and solve their problems.

For example, I’ve absolutely loved working on revamping our documentation structure.
We were previously using Confluence for our documentation, but we were able to spin up the documentation, use the latest technologies and tools to have the documentation that looks good for the brand, thereby, making integration and adoption easier for people.
By transitioning from Confluence to a more modern documentation tool, we improved user experience and ease of integration. This new structure separates the 'what' from the 'how', making it easier for users to find the information they need.
A typical day in my life
My day starts after stand-up. I usually have meetings with merchants who want to integrate us on their platform, reply to emails or integrations, and follow up on new requests on our different channels: Slack, Zendesk, WhatsApp, etc. We are constantly monitoring all those channels and making sure that we are responding and solving problems.
We always have a project we're integrating, so I’m constantly checking in with the stakeholders to get updates and fix anything that needs fixing. If we're deploying a new service, I also work on that - coding, testing, integrating, and troubleshooting issues. 
I also meet with sales teams to understand new developments or any changes on the market side of things, what we're doing, the services we can offer, our fees, and our products. That's what a day looks like—a lot of calls and programming.
Looking ahead, I aim to integrate AI tools to streamline support and enhance customer interaction. Imagine a single channel where users can reach out and get instant, accurate responses – that’s the future we’re working towards.
Want to work in the intersection of engineering, sales and support? We have an opening for you on the Integration Engineering team.

#WhatIDo: A day in the life of a Mobile Engineer
byNathaniel Ogunye
I absolutely love waking up to do the work I do at Moniepoint because I can see how much impact my contribution makes. 
When you’re building a bank for use on the go, your work as a Mobile Engineer takes on a larger meaning. 
Your job isn’t just adjacent to the company's mission- it is critical to the success of the company and its products. 


I learned about Moniepoint from friends in school and colleagues from work during and after my SIWES. They spoke a lot about Moniepoint (then TeamApt) and how they solve engineering problems. After school, there was a wait period before I was called up for the National Youth Service Corp, and family members encouraged me to start applying for jobs.
That’s when I found an opening for a Flutter Developer, and my Moniepoint journey began.
My work as a Mobile Engineer
Being a mobile engineer involves building software for mobile phones. For us at Moniepoint, this means giving our customers ease of business, access to financial services, and pretty much everything else that allows them to power their financial dreams, all from their mobile phones.
As a Mobile Engineer, I work on developing features that customers need. We're constantly trying to find ways to ease users' experience of the mobile app, so you’ll find me considering many flows with other engineers, answering questions like: What's the best user experience? What's the best way we can implement these features?
I also solve many technical and optimisation problems, such as getting the user into the app as quickly as possible, getting the experience as fast as possible, and having minimal friction whenever they use it. We continually anticipate and fix any problems that users might face, so they can just get into the app and do whatever they love. 
A snapshot of what my day usually looks like
My work starts around eight o'clock. I usually start the day by responding to all my messages. Stand-up starts around 8:30 am and lasts for 30 minutes. I sync with the rest of the mobile engineers. We note the kind of blockers we're facing, and help one another work through them.
After the mobile stand-up, real programming work starts. I work on new features and fix bugs and other issues raised by the QA Engineers or Technical Support Engineers until 4 p.m. After pushing the new internal build, I'll then work with the QA engineer to fix any bugs or issues they discover. 
Recently, we've been doing internal demos with business every other day. At 4:30 pm, we show what we've been working on, doing a full flow from the user component straight down to what users will see in the future.
I’ll never forget when we built the Moniepoint Personal app, which has been the highlight of exciting things I’ve worked on. We had a really short time constraint, and it's still shocking to this day that we could deliver that app in that short timeframe.
Languages and skills required
As a mobile engineer here, Flutter is the major language you need to be good at, but you should have a solid background in native developments, native Android, and native iOS. You should also be able to communicate through channels between Flutter and native services. 
You should also be experienced with other tools to help make your development easy - Firebase and Crashlytics, for example. Writing scripts is also essential because you’d need to write new scripts to build the app or run tests—writing tests, integration tests, unit tests, etc. 
Your data structure and algorithm skills have to be very solid because we do a lot of optimisations, and you'll be dealing with many large datasets.
What I love about working at Moniepoint
I love the way I’ve grown here! You get to meet the best of the best, and also get to work with people from all over the world. 
How you think and solve problems will change, so growth is definitely one of the best things that has happened to me while working with Moniepoint.
I also love seeing our blue POS out there. The products we build are being used by my family and friends, including my mom, and that’s a good feeling.
For fun
I love cooking, so when I want to decompress, I try out new recipes, too. Some turn out well, others not so much, but I enjoy the process of experimenting with food. 
I recently mastered the art of making Amala (a staple swallow food originating from Nigeria). I had to learn to make Amala a lot, because my girlfriend loves it.
Ready to build for the next billion Africans? We have an opening on our Mobile team!

How I transitioned to product management within Moniepoint from a background in customer support
byPriscilla Onyeachonam
Hi, I’m Priscilla, but I prefer to go by Amaka, mostly because it reminds me of my background as an Igbo girl in Nigeria. 
I’m currently a product manager at Moniepoint, but I started out as a customer support officer.
 I’ll be sharing a bit of my background and how it’s helped to shape what I do today. Care to join me on this journey?
Let’s go!
First, I’m one of those people in a career that has nothing to do with what they studied. I’m a first-class graduate of Microbiology from Covenant University. Still, in my second year, I had the opportunity to intern at a laboratory, and that was when I started doubting that I wanted to pursue microbiology as a career. It felt a bit too monotonous for me.  
After my final exams, I wanted to understand the ‘labour market’, so I started applying for different jobs—particularly those that sounded fun. That’s how I found myself at an interview for a Customer Support role. I guess I did a good job selling myself and landed an internship as a Customer Support Officer for our market loans product. 
Initially, I accepted the offer just to test the labour market, but the longer I worked and interacted with the customers, the more I fell in love with the Fintech space and what we were doing at Moniepoint. I started to realise that I am very empathetic. I was particularly intrigued by the fact that small and medium-scale informal business owners could easily access loans via Moniepoint. So what started as a test became a passion, and I knew I wanted to remain in the Fintech space. 
When my internship was over, I wasn’t just retained but was also promoted to lead a small team that combined operations and customer success. This was when I knew for sure that Fintech was here to stay for me. I enjoyed the nitty-gritty of how each thing worked. Thankfully, my then-line manager, Tobi, spoke with me about my career trajectory and interests. After explaining the parts I loved the most about my job, he advised me to look into product management, and that day, it dawned on me - I love being the middleman. So, I started taking courses on product management. 
Point A to Point G
If you’re wondering, point A stands for ‘admired the role’, and point G stands for ‘got the role’. So this is between when I realised I wanted to do Product Management and when I actually started. Shortly after the conversation with Tobi, we slowed down the Market Loans project. The goal was to return to the drawing board and see how to accommodate more businesses. Hence, I was moved to the onboarding team within Monnify. This meant that most of my work was more customer-facing, just like in the beginning. I would work during my shift hours and use my spare time to take online courses. 
As I trained to become a Product Manager, I hoped that I’d get the opportunity to apply my new skills here at Moniepoint. Then, I read Temitope’s story and was encouraged to keep the dreams alive. 
By my second year working here, I had moved from being an intern to leading the market loans operations team and then leading an integrations and onboarding support team in Monnify. At the same time, I kept my eyes on the ball. At this point, Damilare was my team lead, and I had a conversation where I explained what my next career trajectory was like. While he encouraged me, he explained that the company was only hiring Technical Product Managers at that point. Obviously, I had no core technical background, so I started looking for other opportunities or ways to apply what I was learning and grow in my career.
I must say, this wasn’t the best period in my career journey because it felt like I suddenly realised what I wanted to do, but as I tried to achieve my dreams, they couldn’t be farther from my reality. However, if you’re well accustomed to DreamMakers, then you know grit is one of our core values, and I wasn’t going back on my dream at all.
What it feels like to get your dream job
In one word - unbelievable. Shortly after I started searching for external opportunities, a role for a Business Product Manager within Moniepoint opened up. It was perfect timing, and I had the skills needed. With my fingers crossed, I applied for the role, gave the interviews my best shot, and here I am today, a Business Product Manager with the Monnify Team. 
How I apply what I learnt as a customer support officer in my role as a Business Product Manager
As a product manager, my role is the middleman with enough authority to make decisions that would favour both the supplier and the receiver of the goods. In fact, most of the time, the receiver is the priority when I have to make decisions. Argh, let’s cut to the chase.
I have enjoyed working as a product manager, and when I reminisce, I see how much my customer success background has impacted my decision-making process.  Yes, I had taken courses on product management, and I was very much aware that the bedrock of building a product should depend on the customers' actual needs, but it is real to me now.
Products are made for people, so every time we’re trying to improve on a product or create a new one, I’m always seeing things clearly from the customer’s point of view. It’s like I have a superpower where I can read between the lines of what my customers are saying and what they aren’t saying. With my background, I’d boldly say that I am leading my team to build/improve on the right product, at the right time, and in the right way for our customers. 
The impact of our well-informed products
I don’t think it’d be nice to wrap up my story without sharing some of my most impactful projects. Firstly, as a product manager, it’s quite difficult to pick one feature and peg it as your most preferred. Still, I’ll just focus on what I consider one of my most impactful projects since becoming a Business Product Manager, and that’s the Bulk Transfer UI feature we recently launched.
The feature allows Monnify merchants to automate transfers to third-party beneficiaries without using an API. Before now, customers who made transfers from their dashboard could only transfer to their account details linked to the Monnify account we managed. But we built a simpler, faster system that’s equally security-tight.
We still have more projects in the pipeline that I can’t share until we’ve launched. Beyond my time as a BPM, I’d say that Monnify’s most impactful product still has to be the virtual wallets. I consider it the most impactful because we were the first to create that solution for a very huge problem that Nigerians and the Fintech industry were experiencing at the time it was launched. 
What the future holds
Honestly, I don’t see myself leaving product management any time soon. This feels like the most certain I have been since my university days. I know what I want to do for the next five years (surprised, yeah?), and I’m ready to give all it takes to get there. For a place like Moniepoint, as long I grow deeper technically, build products that reflect customer empathy and continue to apply grit to push projects, I know I’m covered.
Let me end this with an open invitation to you. You could be like me, who started out a bit unsure of what exactly she wants but has now grown and is pursuing her dreams. I want you to know that dreams can be powered at any stage, and whatever stage you’ve found yourself, I bet there’s a role waiting for you. Visit our careers page, and let’s get this dream together.

How to Register a Business Name in Nigeria with the CAC on your Moniepoint Business Banking App
byChidinma Nwonye
Have you noticed a sudden change in your business name to your BVN name on your Moniepoint Business Banking App? Don't worry; we're here to explain. 
The Central Bank of Nigeria now requires every business that wants to operate a bank account with its business name to register with the Corporate Affairs Commission. 
The good news is that you can now complete this registration process using your Moniepoint Business Banking App for 19,000 naira. Rest assured, it's a secure, reliable, and trusted way to register your business name. 
In this article, we'll explain the CAC, the benefits of registering your business name, and how to do it on the Moniepoint Bank app. 
What is the Corporate Affairs Commission (CAC)?
The Corporate Affairs Commission is the Nigerian government body responsible for regulating, incorporating, registering, and managing the formation of companies in Nigeria. 
The CAC was introduced in 1990 with the passing of the Companies and Allied Matters Act, which grants a proprietor or partner the right to conduct their business under a business name.
Note that Individuals/Proprietors can register business names without the services of a legal practitioner, chartered Accountant, or Chartered Secretary.
(Source)
Benefits of Registering Your Business Name with the Corporate Affairs Commission
Why should you register your business name with the CAC on the Moniepoint Business Banking app? There are numerous benefits of doing so, and some of them include the following:
1. You receive a Certificate of Registration
When you successfully register your business with the Corporate Affairs Commission through your Moniepoint Banking app, you automatically receive a certificate of registration. This certificate of registration comes in handy for various authentication and verification processes. Fortunately, you can obtain your CAC e-certificate without walking into a nearby CAC office. 
2. Boost Your Businesses' Trustworthiness
As a business, what matters most is your ability to gain the undivided trust and loyalty of your customers. Having a CAC-registered business name improves your trustworthiness, thereby making your customers more at ease, knowing the business can be tracked. Your customers feel safer paying into your Moniepoint Business account with your registered business name than a personal account. Just that proud-looking certificate hung on the wall of your business place shows the right authority that customers look out for.
3. Flexibility
Registering your business name in Nigeria quickly with just a few clicks on your Moniepoint Business Banking App takes your business flexibility to a new level. As a business owner, you receive your CAC certificate and functional banking account to conduct your business with ease and peace of mind.  
4. Your Business Attracts Investors
The chances of your business attracting investors become higher when it is christened with a CAC-registered name. Most investors feel assured investing in a registered business instead of an unregistered one. This ultimately gives your business greater chances of raising significant capital, granting you an edge over your competitors.
5. It Saves your Business from Sanctions and Liabilities
Running your business with a registered business name is mandatory in Nigeria, and by doing so, you save your business from sanctions and complications. 
Additionally, you can protect your business as a private liability company from liabilities such as paying back loans and fines with personal funds. This is because the law views your company as a separate entity under the eyes of the law.
How to Register a Business Name with the CAC on your Moniepoint Business Banking App
You can register your business name on the Corporate Affairs Commission website, but as a Moniepoint Business account holder, we've added the registration right on your app. 
Simply follow the steps below to begin; 
1. Log in to your Moniepoint Business Banking dashboard and click on the CAC registration banner at the top. 
2. After clicking on the banner, you'll see a page showing your business information. The information contains details such as the registration cost and a list of documents the CAC requires for your business name registration.
3. Once you see the requirements displayed and wish to continue, click on 'proceed'. You'll see a page where you can select the type of business registration you want to perform. However, on the Moniepoint Business Banking app, you can choose only the 'business name registration' option.  
4. To proceed to the next step, you need to have successfully. If you haven't done so, you'll receive an error message preventing you from continuing.
5. Once you have linked your NIN to your business account, you can proceed to a page where you'll be required to provide your business information.
The details you'll be required to provide of your business include;
Date of commencement: this refers to the date you reckon your business started as a business owner.
Business Category & Subcategory: 
This refers to the business sector that your business operates in.
The business category selected influences the subcategories that you can choose.
Not all Business categories and subcategories are allowed to register business names; therefore, a validation check will confirm that the selected business category and subcategory are eligible for registration. 
Business Description.
This refers to the description of the business in your words as the business owner.
The business description content must be at least 30 characters and at most 160 characters.
The CAC would flag keywords within the business description that are related to the disallowed business categories and subcategories.
Staff size.
This refers to the number of employees in the business.
You will be allowed to choose from a list of ranges.
Source of funds.
6. After providing your business information, you will then be directed to the next page, where you can choose your preferred business name. 
You will be required to provide two names you wish to name your business, which will be verified to ensure that no other Moniepoint customer has the same name pending verification. 
The names will also be verified to ensure that they don't contain prohibited words and that they haven't previously been registered with the CAC. You'll know if your names are okay to use if you are allowed to proceed to the next stage after clicking 'continue.'
7. The next step will be for you to provide some personal information relevant to the registration with CAC. Some of the required fields are:
Gender
Nationality
Occupation
8. On the next page, you'll be required to upload a valid means of identification, such as your NIN document, driver's license, or Voter's card.
9. Next, input your business address in the required field. You can also use your residential address if the details are already in your Moniepoint business bank app.
10. Then, you proceed to the next page, the Attestation page. You'll see the details you filled out on this page while completing the business name registration process. 
This step allows you to review your inputted details and edit them if necessary before submission. Once you are satisfied with the displayed information, click 'I Attest.' 
After this, your information is submitted to the CAC business registration service. However, if incorrect information is flagged, you won't be allowed to proceed to the final step until you rectify it. 
11. Once the business registration service successfully sends and receives your information, you'll be navigated to the 'Payment Page.' 
On this page, you will see information about the payment you will make for your business name registration, your current account balance, and the account from which the payment will be debited. 
If you are satisfied with the payment information, you can then click on the 'Confirm Payment' Button to process the payment.
If the current Available balance is insufficient for the transaction, you will be informed, and the 'Confirm Payment' button will be greyed and inactive.
Suppose the system encountered an error while processing the transaction or the transaction failed from your Moniepoint business account. In that case, you will get an error message and will not be allowed to proceed.
If your payment transaction is successful, you'll be shown a page that shows that your request has been successfully processed and is in a pending state at CAC.
12. When you click on 'Continue to Dashboard' or login to the app, you will be navigated to your dashboard. 
Here, you will no longer see the CAC Business Registration banner; rather, an 'alert' banner showing that your business name registration has started will be displayed. 
The alert displayed below will show only for a business owner who has successfully submitted their information to Moniepoint to be sent to CAC and made payment.
In the case where you have attested to your information but are yet to make payment, you'll see the following alert below;
13. If the CAC has approved any of your preferred business names, you'll see an alert like this shown below
Once you click on the 'Download Certificate' button, you will be shown the approved business name, and your CAC Registration certificate will be downloaded to your device.
14. If the registration failed and your application was rejected, you will receive an alert on your dashboard stating so. Once you click on the 'view details button', you will see the complete details.
Bottom Line
And it's as easy as that! With Moniepoint Business Banking, you can easily register your business name and get it approved from the comfort of your dashboard. 
Register your business name with the CAC to boost your credibility, and let nothing stand in the way of smooth and flexible business transactions.

Moniepoint is Africa’s fastest growing fintech - what this means for financial inclusion in Africa
byDidi Uwem
For the second year running, Moniepoint has been listed as Africa's fastest-growing fintech by the Financial Times. 
In this survey, companies were ranked by their revenue’s absolute growth rate and compound annual growth rate (CAGR) between 2019 and 2022, and our growth rates of [7,979]% (absolute) and [332]% (CAGR) put us as Africa’s fastest-growing company. 
But what does 'fastest growing fintech' mean for the millions of businesses and individuals all around the continent? 
We’re driving access to banking.
We’ve been on a mission to bring financial happiness to everyone wherever they are, and that is helping drive financial inclusion for people who would otherwise be underserved and deprived of access to financial opportunities. 
As of 2018, before the period in the FT’s review, about 51% of Nigerians did not have access to formal banking services. This critical first window of financial inclusion was a clear gap. In 2023, that number dropped to 36%.
This significant growth has been deeply felt by millions of businesses in the informal sector that do not have access to regular formal banking services. More people have business accounts because we’ve been able to leverage our strong distribution network. 
People no longer have to go to banking halls, the banking halls are going to them.
But this is just an entry point for financial inclusion. 
We’re driving access to payment services.
EFInA’s report shows that access to payment services has grown by 12% during the same period. This means that more people can now easily make digital payments, and more businesses can receive them. 
Again, Moniepoint’s speedy growth has been a core driver of this. What, you don’t believe that? As of February 22, 2023, we activated a new payment terminal every 30 seconds in Nigeria. We’ve handled issues with reliability, lack of access, and fraud so well that millions of businesses now trust us to help them grow. You can check out more details here. 
Beyond terminals, Moniepoint is also creating market-leading innovations in web payments with the introduction of virtual accounts which has taken Nigeria’s eCommerce market by storm.
As more people are able to pay for stuff they love, there’s still a critical piece in the puzzle. 
We’re driving access to credit.
Credit access is a vital component of financial inclusion, both for individuals and particularly for small and medium enterprises (SMEs), which form the backbone of many African economies. However, only 15% of SMEs have access to much-needed financing to grow their businesses.
Moniepoint is changing this space by offering working capital loans that have a tangible impact on business sustainability and growth. As of 2023, we’ve disbursed over $70 million in loans to thousands of small businesses, a much-needed capital injection that’s helping businesses thrive in all sectors of the economy.
We’re digitising informal businesses.
The informal sector, which employs the majority of Africa's workforce, has historically been underserved by conventional financial institutions. Moniepoint’s strategy has helped to change this narrative. Our recent partnership with the CAC, for example, will ensure that 30 million businesses will become formalised in the next five years, giving them access to a full range of financial services and government assistance.
Conclusion
Everywhere you go in Nigeria, the distinct ping of our terminals is the sound of an expanding business or a thriving partner. All our tools bring everyone that much closer to greater financial empowerment. This listing validates our commitment to making financial services accessible to people everywhere.

Back to the dream: how my search for career alignment brought me back to Moniepoint
byOpemipo Kolawole
I recently read the story of how Tobi left Moniepoint and returned, and it made me reflect a bit more on my own story. And during my reflection, I decided to share. I like to think of myself as an explorer. In my bid to explore, I’ve found myself in and out of Moniepoint, but I’m back, and here’s my story.
First of all, introduction…
My name is Opemipo, and I work in the finance department. Currently, most of my time is spent on the Financial Control Management side of things. As required, I work with the Corporate Finance team, supporting them with fundraising, etc. So, just call me the finance guy.
In the beginning
As I said at the beginning, I am mostly intrigued by exploring things, so I became very interested in the tech space after my university education. I’d equip myself with as much information as possible about tech and startups in Africa. One of the days I was doing my ‘mindless’ scrolling, I came across a blog post on one of my tech editorials. It was a story about how TeamApt (Moniepoint) had bootstrapped, and they were doing it successfully. I remember reading the story repeatedly, researching about the founders and the company, just to be sure I understood what I was reading.
Till this moment, that is still the most fascinating story I have read about a fintech startup in Nigeria. You know, it is one thing to bootstrap and another to make a profit. So, during my research, I went to the Careers page and searched for a role that I was a good fit for. That’s how I first joined the company. I joined as an intern, and that doubled as my placement for my NYSC. 
It was a smooth, rough ride. I enjoyed how fast-paced we were. Even if it was my first official experience in a corporate setting, the pulse felt right. When I joined the team, the finance team was being built, so Kemi and I pretty much started the team and created the operational processes. I learnt on the job and learnt fast. But as someone who always wants to see what options are out there, I felt like I wanted to spend more time doing core finance, and TeamApt (now Moniepoint) didn’t seem to be giving me the level of finance work I wanted, so I applied to a traditional bank as a graduate trainee. 
How blue was the grass on the other side?
As a graduate trainee, the typical process is to be rotated across departments, and I had my fair share of this. I worked across customer support, operations, and sales until I landed in my desired department—finance. Here, I was rotated again until I ended up in the investment management team. 
My work was mainly to support fund managers with analysis. My colleagues liked me, especially my line manager. For them, there was something about how I worked, how I desired to work more and my use of finance software that thrilled them.
Absence makes the heart…
I was away for 9 months, but I don’t think my heart really left Moniepoint. At every slight instance, I’d compare the process of getting things done here vs. there, as well as the expertise DreamMakers displayed. I had hoped we’d imbibe some of the core values there, but I soon understood that those core values made Moniepoint stand out, and no other company would mirror what we had here. I was finally doing the finance I wanted to, but it was moving a bit slowly. Because I was in contact with a couple of people from Moniepoint, I had a bit of an idea of what our growth was like, so I decided to come back. 
Back to the dream
Returning has been one of the greatest growth trajectories for my career. Returning to see the growth and having to work on more exciting projects has made up for the two years I was away. When I left, we were just an agency bank barely processing up to 1bn in a month, but on rejoining, we were doing as much as 1 trillion a month. Also, evolving to a full business bank caught my attention again because of the problems we were solving for them. 
When I returned, I joined as a corporate finance analyst, working with the VP of corporate finance on various projects, including financial planning and analysis, fundraising, and M&As. I got the thrills I missed almost immediately, as I was tasked with creating an investor report for a fundraising round we were conducting at that point. I still consider this one of my most significant projects, especially because of the time frame I had to complete it. 
One thing I am happy about is that as the company grows, I can also see myself growing. As a Corporate Finance Analyst, I am now a director, leading the Finance business partners, who are responsible for managing the financial affairs of Moniepoint’s SBUs.
Why am I sharing my story?
I’ve had many people ask me if I am glad I returned to Moniepoint and what the big deal about Moniepoint is that I had to return. The answer is so within reach - we have high-quality people. People who are ready to roll their sleeves and get the job done. You also get paid well. And of course, the impact we’ve had across business and personal banking. These are the top reasons for me. So if you’ve left and want to come back, or it’s your first time, I’d tell you for free that you’re making a good choice. Check our careers page for a role that suits you.

What’s the Point: The battle with erroneous transfers
byEmmanuel Paul
Have you ever sent money to the wrong person or account? We’ve all been there, and so have millions of people globally. It could be completely innocent, like that time I mistakenly sent airtime to a stranger who ended up praying for me. Or it could be serious, like a deal gone wrong with an Instagram vendor or the WhatsApp group admin for a Ponzi scheme. 
In this entry for What’s The Point, we’ll explore erroneous transfers. We talked to Grace, Dolor, and Goodness from our legal, fraud and transaction monitoring teams to figure out why it happens, what we can do when it happens, and why the solution works the way it does. 
I gave up on trying to make the headline rhyme like 'What’s the point of the battle with erroneous transfers', so I resolved to give you insights that will make you forget the lack of a poetic title. Back to the issue at hand. Here’s how we’ll structure the story to learn: 
What erroneous transfers mean and the forms they take
What the regulations say about resolving erroneous transfers
How it compares with other global financial institutions
Why it’s so hard to resolve 
What we do and can still do about it. 
The many faces of erroneous bank transfers
Erroneous transfers or accidental bank transfers refer to any movement of funds caused by mistake, fraud, or other unintended circumstances. You could call them accidental, mistaken, misdirected, or unauthorised transfers. The examples in my introduction allude to the different forms of erroneous transfers. It’s a typical headache for individuals and businesses. 
In their purest form, erroneous transfers involve innocent customer or bank teller errors, such as typing the wrong bank account number, selecting the wrong recipient from the saved beneficiary, or typing/writing 10,000 instead of 1,000. Now, it extends beyond that. It can also include:
Unauthorised access: A friend or fiend could gain access to your account and send money without your permission. 
Business gone bad: You could send money to someone under deceptive circumstances. It could be an online vendor that doesn’t exist or an outright fraudster.
Fraudulent senders: This is the reverse, where senders claim a legitimate transaction was done in error.
Technical glitches: Customers could get debited twice for the same transaction.
Subscription blues: You could forget to cancel a subscription and get hit with a shocking debit. 
Currency fluctuations: This could cause you to send the wrong amount when sending money from one country to another. 
Individuals and businesses face these issues when sending money today, but it has been a long time coming. 
Before the digital age, transfer errors with checks, passbooks, and tellers. Technology has given us more places to buy from and seamless tools to make payments, increasing the chances of errors. You’ll see these issues on either side of the pond.  A survey by the UK-based payments firm VibePay, showed that 25% of UK banking customers had misdirected funds at one point, which has led to customers losing £204 million. 
In 2023, US consumers lost $392 million to online shopping gone wrong and $2.6 billion by sending money to people pretending to be who they’re not. 
How regulations resolve erroneous transfers
Two main bodies help police financial issues like this in Nigeria: the judiciary (courts) and the Central Bank of Nigeria (CBN). The CBN provides rules under which every financial institution operates. However, like in most democracies, the courts have the final say whenever there's a dispute. 
The Central Bank of Nigeria’s 'Regulation On Instant (Inter-Bank) Electronic Funds Transfer Services In Nigeria 2018' shows how erroneous transfers should be handled. If the bank makes an error, internal processes will be used to rectify the issue. When customers make a mistake, that’s where things get interesting. The CBN recommends the following steps:
The customer reaches out to the person they mistakenly sent the money to directly and arranges for an amicable refund. 
If the person doesn’t respond, the customer should contact their bank. The customer’s bank should then inform the recipient‘s bank of the issue. Then, the recipient bank can place a Post No Debit (PND) on the account while obtaining consent from the recipient. 
If the bank still can’t obtain consent, the Internal auditors of both banks have to meet to resolve the issue. 
Building on the CBN’s framework, the customer might have to get a court order to reverse the funds if the recipient can't be reached. In most Nigerian states, funds below N5 million (or N10 million in Lagos) can be retrieved with a court order from a Magistrates’ Court. Amounts above this would require the High Court of Justice. 
I know that this sounds like a lot, but there are a few reasons why it exists. Between protecting your rights as a customer, the rights of the business owner, and those of the banking institutions (yes, they have rights, too), a few checks have to be in place. Here are some important facts to note: 
Customer rights: Banks do not have the right to touch customers' money without consent. The banks could be sued if a reversal is made without a court order.
Timing is important: It’s very critical to report the transactions immediately they happen. When a court order is needed, it should be done as quickly as possible, as PNDs only last for 72 hours.
Banks need to investigate: The recipient bank needs to find out if it was indeed an erroneous transaction or if a transaction was completed. If the recipient provides evidence that the money was for a transaction, 
If you’re still not convinced, it also works similarly elsewhere in the world. In the US, the Electronic Funds Transfer Act, Reg E, treats the customer’s error claim as alleged until the bank completes its investigation and reviews the provided required documentation. Similarly, the Financial Conduct Authority in the UK has the Payments Service Regulations that mandate banks to reverse money only if an error has been confirmed. 
What customers need to prevent
The data shows that people are losing millions to imposters and fraudulent online shopping. Issues with erroneous transfers in Nigeria demand that customers balance speed and attention to detail, depending on the context.  
Emails with suspicious messages and links can give fraudsters the tools they need to impersonate consumers. But these are becoming more obvious. What’s not obvious are social media trends that ask users to provide their account details or other deeply personal information. 
How Moniepoint manages erroneous transfers
Moniepoint handles erroneous transfers by being as fair, flexible, and strict with regulations as possible. When we get a report, here’s what we do;
We try to be as transparent as possible by copying the other party in the mail to make sure that an erroneous transfer actually happened. In this case, we can determine if this was a case of fraud and pay extra attention to it. 
We go even further with business owners by including their relationship managers and their phone numbers for direct contact. We ask for consent to debit the funds if it was an error or evidence of value delivered, which we then review. 
Most importantly, we pay attention to the possibility of forged documents, from receipts to court orders. This is critical for court orders, as some people might forge and print what seems to be a court order with no legal backing, 
Sometimes, we contact the relevant legal authorities to ensure we have valid documents. We keep building our systems to ensure the highest security and transparency in different instances. You can read more about our work with security and biometrics here. 
So there you have it. Erroneous transfers are a thing globally. People lose money, and regulatory bodies across the globe try to strike a balance to protect consumers and everyone else in the financial system. It’s still a work in progress, and we’re committed to playing our part.

#WhatIDo: A Day in the Life of an Enterprise Architect 
byOlarewaju Showemimo
I remember my first day at Moniepoint two years ago. It was the 3rd of January, and I was so excited to start the year on a new job. I came in as an Engineer with an overarching big-picture view of what my role could evolve into, the ways that my work would matter, and the possible futures ahead of me. 
And… as fate would have it, a couple of weeks into joining as an engineer, I was put on a project that moved me into the role of an Enterprise Architect. Now that I’ve worked as an Enterprise Architect for over two years, I can tell you what the role looks like.
Who’s an Enterprise Architect at Moniepoint?
Being an Enterprise Architect entails a number of things, but it majorly means being able to translate requirements into a finished product or a usable application. And that could mean designing in a particular way, applying some design principles, architectural disciplines and other things, while infusing your experience in that field/industry.

An enterprise architect at Moniepoint serves as a bridge between the business and the engineer who works on the major features. They are responsible for coming up with a design that best addresses the problem (the problem in this case is the requirements) and helping the developers understand how the business sees it and how they should see it as engineers. So, the EA picks the requirements and, at the end of the day, comes up with a finished product.
A snapshot of what every day looks like
My days aren’t exactly fixed or predictable, but there's a template that I like to follow because it brings structure to my life - I wake up early, do my morning rituals, and then get to my PC 10 minutes before 8 a.m.
Other times, I get to the PC before then doing code reviews. Otherwise, I'll go to my PC, prepare for the standup, and attend to team requests after the standup. 
Sometimes, I also have a day planned out. On those days, the highest priority could be production issues or open MRs. If the engineers need a deep dive, we block out time during the day to do that. Sometimes, if they have some blockers mentioned during standup, I could ask them to also wait behind.

To simplify it, it should be: attend standup in the morning, get feedback on the standup, attend to open MRs, plan for deep dive sessions, and stay open to checking for production issues. I also need to attend leadership meetings with my VP, and product manager just to be sure that we're always on the same page,  and that the OKRs we're committed to are still being worked on. And if we are experiencing any form of blocker due to resource constraints or any other constraints, we discuss those kinds of issues.
Keeping the process simple.
My main responsibility is to simplify the process. Regardless of how hard or big the requirement is, I should not transfer the complexity to the engineers that I work with. I should also be able to transfer the knowledge that I've gained from the business to them. 

Sometimes, this involves me sharing the approach we’re taking with each member of the team during their deep dive. I also need to walk them through the current, existing system and the proposed system and explain why we are doing things a certain way. This helps broaden their technical creativity or awareness. 
For instance, an engineer might think they're exposing an endpoint to get names, but in the long run, they're actually exposing an endpoint to get the names of about 10,000 users or more. That could help them say, 'Okay, no, this shouldn't be paginated.' Therefore, they make good technical decisions along the way as well.
A recent fulfilling project
We recently did some work in East Africa, and I functioned as the EA, which kind of led the whole initiative. I derived a lot of joy in understanding their existing system and fleshing out the right architecture to merge it with how Moniepoint works – improving their technology with ours. 

There was a lot of work around preempting and building technical moats to merge the systems technically without issues. This extends to designing reliable and fault-tolerant systems and creating systems of services along the line. For example, the transfer process—defining it, the recurring transfer process, the user onboarding process, and several other components that play a major role in completing a business banking application. 

It is one of the biggest things that I really enjoyed because I was able to see the endless possibilities that exist in terms of expansion, technical scale, and everything happening along the line. I would say it's also helped me understand some core systems and be intentional about creating an extendable system that would be reusable for diverse initiatives and other countries.
If you like being at the centre of business, engineering, and things that scale, we have 2 Enterprise Architects roles open. Check them out here and here, to join our team!

RIPPLES: How Oluwatosin helps prevent business losses as a POS Technician
byChidinma Enemanna
Do POS terminals last forever? What happens when you drop one or its screen glitches? Does that even happen? This question has been ringing in my head for some months, and I decided to chat with Tosin Solarin, a POS technician at Moniepoint, about his role and how it impacts the larger picture at Moniepoint.
Tosin Solarin describes his role as being a community hero in disguise. He provides tools and support to business owners to keep their transactions smooth and make their customers happy. As Tosin puts it, ‘Every transaction is a chance to help someone grow their dream'. Join me as we learn more about Tosin Solarin and his role as a POS technician at Moniepoint. 
Hi Tosin. What was your dream job while growing up? 
Growing up, my dream was always to become an engineer. I pursued this passion by studying electrical and electronic engineering, which aligns closely with what I do now. Originally, I envisioned myself in the oil sector, but life took a different turn. Although I didn't anticipate working as a POS technician, I'm fulfilling my goal of being an engineer, just in an unexpected way.
That’s great! How did you get started as a POS technician?
My interest in electronics began during my university days. After graduation, I took on various jobs outside of engineering but didn’t find the fulfilment I was seeking. In 2020, a friend introduced me to the possibility of working in fintech as a POS technician, highlighting the sector's rapid advancement and the innovative nature of POS technology. This resonated with my passion for electronics and the industry's dynamic nature. 
I soon found myself learning more about POS devices, their functionality, and how to support customers using these systems. My journey led me through several fintech companies, and in 2023, I joined Moniepoint. I was drawn to Moniepoint because of its promising prospects and a more supportive policy environment than my previous positions.
How satisfied do you feel working in your current role?
I find great satisfaction in solving problems and making people happy, which is a big part of my job. As a POS technician at Moniepoint, I primarily work within our team, but I also have direct interactions with business owners. 
It’s incredibly fulfilling to resolve their issues with POS devices. Being part of a team that actively resolves issues for around 20,000 faulty terminals, I truly feel I’m making a difference and contributing to our collective goal of problem-solving.
How would you say your role as a POS technician impacts both businesses and the broader society? 
My role is crucial in supporting business owners by ensuring their POS machines function correctly. When a POS device malfunctions, it comes to me through a chain that starts with the business owners and moves through business relationship managers. 
As the final end of this chain, I handle both software and hardware issues that might arise with these devices. By keeping these machines running smoothly, I help business owners avoid revenue losses, which is vital not only for their success but also for the economic health of the community. 
In the bigger picture, I act as the glue that holds things together, powering the dreams of business owners and, by extension, supporting the broader economy. 
Does security come to play in your role? What steps do you take to ensure the security and integrity of POS devices? 
To combat security breaches, we conduct ongoing sensitisation programs with state coordinators, who then relay critical security information to business owners. Many owners aren't fully aware of the security features of their POS devices. 
For instance, our POS devices are designed to signal tampering. If a specific component is dislodged, the device will indicate it has been tampered with, and only an authorised technician can reset this alert. 
We've also implemented a new measure after repairing a device, by placnig a security sticker on it. If a device returns to us with this sticker tampered with or removed, we know it’s been handled by an unauthorised person. 
We continue to refine our strategies to ensure security. We strongly advocate that business owners bring their terminals directly to us for any issues rather than relying on unqualified roadside engineers, which often results in ineffective repairs and wasted time.
If you weren't a POS technician, what other career might you have pursued?
I am interested in various other engineering fields, particularly data engineering and software engineering. I've already begun taking courses in data engineering, and if I weren't a POS technician, I would love to pursue a career as a data engineer. The world is constantly evolving, and it's important to expand my skills and adapt to new technological advancements.
Just for fun, if you could switch roles with anyone at Moniepoint, who would it be?
I’d choose Habib, our data engineer! His role aligns closely with my interests, especially since I'm also passionate about data engineering.
I knew it! Thank you so much, Tosin. I enjoyed speaking with you.

Think you can make an impact on the broader society with your role? Explore our open roles and join us today.

What’s the point of Biometrics in banking?
byEmmanuel Paul
At Oyingbo market, Lagos, Nigeria,  the air is filled with shouts and the scent of fresh produce. You're there, hands full of groceries, heart racing as you reach the front of the queue. The seller is impatient, and you're fumbling with your phone, trying to open your banking app. But your PIN, what was it again? With people close enough to peek over your shoulder, the fear of someone catching your PIN adds to the stress. Then, you notice a fingerprint-shaped button on your screen. With a simple touch, the app opens. Relief!
You just avoided a minor mishap, but this moment shows how biometric technology is helping to keep your financial details safe. Gone are the days of relying solely on passwords you use on a million websites, or complex passwords you forget 2 minutes after you set it.  Now, something as personal as your fingerprint can ensure your financial transactions are safe. It's security based on who you are, not just what you can remember.
Beyond finance, this transition to biometric authentication is making our daily interactions with technology smoother and more natural. To unlock our smartphones, to speed up airport check-ins. We spoke with Tolulope, one of the product managers who built Monepoint’s biometric features, to dive into how this technology has evolved, how it works, and the benefits it offers. 

How we got to biometrics
Long before smartphones and the internet, people had to find ways to keep their belongings safe. At the time, the most advanced security was a lock and key, or a secret password only a few people knew. 
In the early days of banking, security meant a strong vault/safe and a complex combination lock. You confirmed your identity with a paper signature and relied on humans to verify. It was a simple time, but signatures could be forged, and keys could be stolen. 
As technology advanced, personal identification numbers (PINs), and passwords came around. With four digits or letters, you can now access your money. Transactions became smoother and 'somewhat’ safer. Yet, we all know how easily we forget passwords,  kids or nephews/nieces easily guess passwords when we put in little effort, and it’s not safe from prying eyes or social engineers. 
We use something far more personal and unique to secure your device or finances. You. Your fingerprint, the shape of your face, your voice, or the pattern of your iris are very hard to duplicate or steal. Right now, biometrics are part of our daily activities and it’s become natural and intuitive.
Interestingly, the use of human features for identification dates back to 500 BC, when ancient Babylonians used clay tablets with fingerprints to record business transactions. In the 19th century, an employer used handprints to identify employees, and a French police officer used body measurements to identify criminals. Sir Francis Galton, created a detailed system for identifying fingerprints. In 1936, an Ophthalmologist, Francis Burch, first proposed the concept of using the iris to identify individuals, and Bells Labs designed a speech recognition system in 1952. The financial sector has followed this evolution. 
Now, let's look at this technology more closely and explain why it's becoming indispensable in our daily lives.
How biometrics work
Think of biometric authentication like your home's front door. Instead of using a key that anyone could copy or lose, it opens only at the sight of your face or the touch of your finger. It's as if your house recognises you and lets you in. Biometric authentication has two parts: 'Bio' (as in 'Biology') and 'Metrics' (as in rules and systems for measuring data, created by really smart people). 
This technology is based on a simple idea: everyone is unique. Just so we’re clear, here are the ways biometrics exist with fintechs today;
Fingerprint Scans: Perhaps the most popular on the list, fingerprint scans capture the ridges and valleys of your fingerprint. While you deal with the image of ridges and valleys at the tip of your finger, just know that every fingerprint is distinct. 
Voice Recognition:  It checks what makes your voice unique, like its pitch, rhythm, and tone.  Imagine it as a voice fingerprint, as distinct as your physical one.
Facial Recognition: This system maps the contours of your face, recognising the distances between your eyes, the shape of your nose, and the pattern of your facial features.
Signature recognition: Here, you don’t just get to sign. It looks at how you sign your name, focusing on pressure, speed, and stroke patterns.
Beyond these three popular types, we also have Iris scans, signature recognition, hand geometry, gait recognition, vein patterns, and DNA analysis.
What makes biometrics so useful?
Let’s face it: No one wants their device or bank accounts compromised, and biometrics offer a higher level of security. Banks and fintech companies, like Moniepoint, use this technology to ensure that it’s really you accessing your account. It’s designed to make transactions smoother and safer.
Fun fact: It will take just 0.19 milliseconds to hack a password you set as 'password'. That’s faster than you can blink.
Fingerprints, for instance, are much harder to forge, steal, or guess than say, signatures or passwords. While it might take you a few seconds to type in what should be a complex password, Biometrics are almost instant. 
How we approach biometric authentication
At Moniepoint, we think banking should be easy, safe, and make you happy. If you’ve been following this series, you should understand that we balance compliance requirements, technology adoption and the customer’s needs. We’re customer-obsessed, we focus on time to delivery, and we have a technically capable team working on features like our biometrics.  
Without getting into technical details you probably don’t care about, we set up our biometric system in a way that reduces the chances of someone getting into a customer’s account. 
We took facial verification beyond taking a picture. You now have to smile or roll your head so the verification company can ensure you’re not holding someone’s picture in front of the camera. 
We also provide constant notifications so the user can see every activity, even log-ins, to spot when something is out of place. The result is we make it way harder for anyone to get access to your account. 
We also set up our systems to be as fast as possible. The benchmark for every transaction we do at Moniepoint, including biometric authentication, is the 100th millisecond. However, some services and APIs are running way below that benchmark.
We did this by making sure we bring in smart and skilled technical team. This team is free to evolve on their own with the company’s support in the background. As a result, we end up building a solid foundation, structure and the right database in a way that benefits the products and features we build.

How My Background in Sales Prepared Me For Recruitment 
byChris Purkis

Hey there! I'm Chris. In this current phase of my life, I’m navigating the world of recruitment at Moniepoint. It’s not common to approach recruitment from a sales perspective, but my experience has shown a pretty strong connection between the two. Here, I will share my ideas on sales and recruitment and how the ways they overlap help find the best people for every role. 
First, let’s start with a bit of my background 
Who is Chris? 
Born and raised in the States, I'm the product of hard-working immigrant parents who carved out a better life for their kids in a cosy East Bay Area suburb. Growing up, it took me a while to realise their sacrifices and how these shaped my perspective on work and life. My mom, an Ecuadorian immigrant, embodies the sense of hard work, independence and grit taught to her by her mother. My dad, a successful professional in the oil and gas industry, showed me the meaning of discipline and perseverance.
My first job didn't come until I was 17, thanks to the comfortable life my parents provided. I worked at a coffee shop as a barista, making coffee and lattes for people. It helped me build my people relations skills. From then on, I took up jobs and roles that leaned towards people and sales.
Stumbling into recruitment, therefore, was a mix of serendipity and my inherent drive to do quality work, treat people with respect, and be kind. Reflecting on it, my approach to recruitment and in a way, my stint in sales have been deeply influenced by my background.


How I found my way into Recruitment 
Remember I said I had a career stint in sales? I sold ads in a school newspaper at the university I attended. I also worked at a non-profit where I was responsible for selling tickets for an annual event, which was our main fundraiser for the year. I also worked as a salesperson in a couple of software start-ups where I was either directly selling or had to get qualified leads booked for my manager to have sales meetings with potential clients. 
I was also in a business fraternity where I was responsible for different things. For example, I was in charge of  'Alumni Relation' where I was responsible for re-building relationships with people who used to be members and raising money from them. I also had to figure out ways to leverage their position in tech companies to benefit our active members. This led to several people finding jobs and internships. Although I didn’t realise it then, I was actually serving as a connecting dot and being a recruiter. 
Through these experiences, I saw that sales and recruitment were alike. This led me to join a recruitment agency as an entry-level recruitment coordinator when I moved to Portugal. When we think about recruitment, it's easy to overlook the skills borrowed from sales that make a recruiter truly exceptional.
The Intersection of Recruitment and Sales
Imagine you were a candidate I was convincing to join Moniepoint. What would you like me to do? What would you like to see or hear? And would that be different from, say, trying to get you to buy something? In my experience, not so much.
Recruitment, like sales, centres on three pillars:
Relationship building
My approach has always been to treat candidates respectfully, genuinely understand their career aspirations, and maintain high-quality interactions. This philosophy isn't something I consciously decided to follow; it reflects the values instilled in me by my parents and my cultural heritage.
Persuasion
Persuasion is another sales skill that plays a pivotal role in recruitment. It’s not about manipulation. Rather, it's the art of presenting opportunities in a way that resonates with candidates. Every time I speak with a potential candidate, I try to highlight how the role aligns with their aspirations and growth. Similarly, in sales, it's about showing the value of a product in meeting a customer's needs. This skill demands a deep understanding of both the product and the customer—or, in the case of recruitment, the role and the candidate. It's about painting a picture of a future that's too compelling to pass up.
Grit
As a recruiter, I’ve come to accept that not every candidate would take up my offer. However, when there’s a candidate I’m sure would offer value to the company, grit is what keeps me going even when the candidate declines. I once followed up with a potential candidate for over 6 months because I was sure the candidate was the best fit for the role.  Grit is perhaps the most critical value I bring to my role: a relentless determination and resilience that I've inherited from my hard-working parents. This quality is necessary in both sales and recruitment. Facing rejections, navigating challenging negotiations, and continuously striving to meet targets require a level of perseverance that not everyone possesses. Grit means pushing through the no’s to get to a yes, constantly refining your approach and never losing sight of your goals. It's about being resourceful, learning from each interaction, and never giving up on finding the perfect match for both candidates and the company.
Interestingly, my experience in sales helped solidify these principles. Sales is about connecting with people, understanding their needs, and providing value. Similarly, recruitment is about connecting the right people with the right roles, understanding the needs of both the candidates and the company, and ensuring a good fit. The two aren't all that different when you boil them down to their essence, as both require empathy, understanding, and the ability to build trust.
My laid-back tone and approachable manner might mask the depth of determination inherited from my parents. My mom's tenacity and my dad's discipline have subtly influenced my work ethic, making me relentless in pursuing quality and excellence in recruitment. This has not only helped me stand out in my field but also in building meaningful, lasting relationships in the professional world.
Moreover, my international background has endowed me with a broader perspective, allowing me to appreciate diversity and leverage it in recruitment strategies. Recognising the strength in diverse experiences and backgrounds has been key in my role, much like it is in sales, where understanding and adapting to various customer backgrounds can make or break deals.


Expanding my Experience at Moniepoint 
My experience at Moniepoint has been nothing short of enlightening, largely due to the incredible people I've had the pleasure of working with. As an international company, Moniepoint has introduced me to individuals from diverse cultural backgrounds, enriching my professional life and personal growth. This diversity mirrors my own multicultural upbringing and aligns with my belief in the strength of diverse perspectives.
Working at Moniepoint, I've found a place where my values—quality, respect, empathy, and grit—are not just appreciated but are part of the company’s values. The opportunity to meet and interact with people from all walks of life has not only enhanced my recruitment skills but has also made my daily work deeply rewarding.

7 Good Money Habits to Start with Your First Salary
byChidinma Nwonye
Ding!! Yup, that's the sound of your first salary payment or probably the first significant salary after a career upgrade. 
Beginning your career journey and getting compensated for it for the first time is exciting and memorable. 
However, as a first-time employee, the associated deductions like taxes and pension annuity contributions can come as a surprise. 
Furthermore, deducting essential expenses like rent, school fees, and home upkeep without a solid financial management plan can overwhelm you. In fact, research shows that  63% of Nigerians say that their income is not enough for them, let alone with dependants. 
Knowing how to manage your money before it hits your bank account enables you to create a long-term safety net for yourself. 
Sounds like a lot of work, right? No worries; we'll explore six good money habits to start with your first salary.
1. Understanding your Fixed Monthly Expenses
A good thing about fixed monthly expenses is that they are expected, and having a fixed income enables you to plan accordingly. Deductions like rent, utility bills, subscriptions, etc., are constant, and you have to ensure that you're spending less than you're earning. 
Ultimately, tracking your expenses on an Excel spreadsheet, apps like Expensify and  GoodBudget, or your notebook helps you stay aware of your expenses and make adequate financial decisions.
2. Create a Budget
A key to appropriately spending your first salary is to create a workable budget. A reasonable budget lets you keep track of your expenses and enables you to start saving realistically.
Listing your expenses in a budget helps you learn what items are necessary and which are non-essential. A common budgeting rule you could start with is the 50-30-20 rule, which involves dividing your income into three groups. 
These categories include 50% for your needs, 30% towards your wants, and 20% for savings. For instance, if you earn 100,000 naira per month, you can set aside 50,000 for rent, school fees, and utilities. 
You can also allocate 30,000 naira for wants, like eating out and entertainment, and finally set aside 20,000 naira for savings. Ultimately, spending according to your budget helps you build good money habits.

3. Set up an Emergency Fund
You should balance the excitement of earning your first salary with the need to plan properly for your financial future. If there's a common truth, it's that life doesn't always go according to plan, which is why you need to build an emergency fund for unexpected uses. 
You can draft out what you consider an emergency, such as a health crisis or an accident. A workable rule of thumb is to have enough savings to handle six months' worth of unexpected expenses. 
Consider putting these funds in a high-yield savings account like the Moniepoint Personal savings plan.

4. Pay off Pending Debts
Earning your money without anyone dictating how you can spend it comes with its temptations. This is why, upon earning your first salary, create a plan to pay off any pending debt and avoid creating more. 
You can maintain solid long-term financial goals by prioritizing paying off essential debts and only taking calculated loans.
5. Start an Investment
The best time to start investing is yesterday. This is a sure way to grow your money even while sleeping. You can start by learning about the various investment options and explore which ones match your risk profile to aid you in making informed decisions. 
Regardless of how little you want to start with, you can gain financial freedom by building your investment portfolio over time.
6. Enjoy Spending your Disposable Income
Whether you wish to save up for a vacation or enjoy the immediate gratification of ordering your long-awaited desires, your disposable income is yours to spend. 
We all have a responsibility to take care of ourselves, and it is advisable to do so after deducting essential expenses. Proper money management can be complicated at first, but your financial situation becomes favourable once you get the hang of it.
7. Saving for Retirement
We all expect to grow old someday, and it's only proper to lay the financial foundations for that phase by saving for retirement. 
By leveraging the principle of compound interest on your initial deposits, you can earn increased interest and build up your retirement accounts. 
Your company-sponsored retirement plans are adequate as you get to put in pre-tax funds and have your company contribute to your retirement plans.
Final Words
Your first salary opens the doors to a lifetime of financial responsibilities, and your ability to channel your finances properly is essential. 
Using a Moniepoint Personal Banking Account enables you to perform reliable and secure transactions with your salary, from saving money and smooth transfers to bill and utility payments.

Why we take Internal Comms to heart at Moniepoint
byGbemi Adekanmbi
At the beginning of the year, we shot this video with our team. In it, we spoke about how we've all found the feeling of what it means to work for a company where you can see the products you create impacting people every day. We've seen our products become a part of not just our lives but also the lives of those around us – customers, and businesses.
Kelvin, who’s on the User Experience team, spoke about how remarkable it felt to see his wife using a product that he had designed. He remembered how she used to shuttle between accounts for her maternal care business before she switched to Moniepoint. Seeing the product he worked on improving her experience was fulfilling.
Almost everyone on our team has a story about someone they know who either uses a Moniepoint product or has been influenced by its impact. And this brings me to why I wrote this short piece about marketing from the inside out.
Typically, organisations think about Marketing from a 'how to reach new customers' perspective, or from a 'selling to new and recycled audiences' perspective. However, thinking about marketing solely from this point of view can be quite limiting and keeps you thinking inside the box. There may be a huge audience you’re not paying attention to - your employees.
In this short article, I’ll attempt to paint the picture of our Internal Communications at Moniepoint. Beyond just conveying information, it is a combination of communicating and marketing to this very valuable group of customers. 
What is Internal Marketing?
Internal Marketing refers to marketing communications directed at the internal stakeholders of an organisation, i.e. the employees. Here, the customers are the employees themselves. Yes, those who build the product, sell the product, help the organisation run efficiently and everything in between - the people who help shape the what and how of the organisation itself.
Why are we crazy about Internal Marketing at Moniepoint?
Information Flow
As a growing company, focusing on Internal Stakeholders helps us move fast without leaving anyone behind. By allotting attention to internal marketing, we make room for information holistically. Company updates, employee activities, processes, and new goals are communicated not only with a view to 'just let people know what's going on', but also to get their buy-in. And getting their buy-in means helping employees understand details about decisions and activities, and what it means for them on an individual level, and for the organisation as a whole.
Engaged employees
We are a bunch of curious, technically adept people at Moniepoint, and we play with these characteristics in internal comms/marketing. We leverage our internal comms to keep employees engaged with one another, especially because we are a remote company—from games where people win prizes and tickets to frequent company hangouts.
For example, we use Workplace to give employees reason and corners to bond over diverse interest points and then hangout based on these interests - we’ve had pockets of movie corner hangouts; we also had a football match in July.
Internal marketing is our surefire way of driving genuine enthusiasm about the company’s products, and activities amongst our employees. We are keen on involvement, so we ensure everyone knows what’s going on, what it means for them as internal stakeholders, and how they can be involved.
Employees and Stakeholders as Influencers
Another reason we take internal marketing to heart is to *whispering* give employees an innate reason to be voltrons of the company's work and culture. Eh, if you’re too young to remember Voltron, think of them as the Avengers instead.
We definitely want our people to talk about the various impact the work they do has on people, communities, and society at large. This is why you see employees excitedly talk about how they feel when they see Moniepoint POS at a Merchant’s store.
Employee branding
We are big on employees being outspoken about their technical depth. An internally engaged employee naturally wants to share their genius with the world. With increased brand awareness, employees are better equipped to do their work.
How we approach Internal Marketing
We use a 2 pronged approach to internal marketing - Content and Policies
Content
We leverage a vibrant content production strategy. We create stories that help people get to know one another, address engaging topics, create interactive activities, and create ways for information to flow. We come up with the most creative ways to convey even the most boring topics and information and get people involved.
Policies & Programs
We have programs in place to nudge our internal customers into the most satisfied group. For example, we started a performance bonus program that ensures employees are rewarded in addition to their salaries based on performance. We also have a policy that inadvertently encourages and cultivates collaboration across levels and departments.
What can you take away from this?
Caveat: We’re not perfect. But the ways we’ve mentioned above ensure that our employees are at the centre of everything we do.

Creating a well-engaged community of employees takes intentionality, especially as the company expands and grows - You want to ensure that there is a constant air of ownership, and a culture of team spirit - a great way to kickstart this is through your internal communications; make it enjoyable, cultivate the values you want on display with the right triggers, and create good policies that ensure the love of your employees. ;)

My framework for leading as an engineer
byKonstantinos Prassas
When I started working at Moniepoint, I knew it would be hard and rewarding, seeing that Moniepoint is a fast-growing company. I love the Moniepoint energy! We don’t wait around for things to happen—we are always at the forefront of changes, envisaging them, making room for them, and creating products and features ahead of the curve. This makes my work here super-rewarding.
Hi, My name is Konstantinos Prassas. I joined Moniepoint in October 2022, as an Enterprise Architect, and now I’m a Principal Software Engineer. This is a short breakdown of how I think about processes.
What every day looks like for me
When I started, there was one payments team, which meant that the team handled every form of payment - card payments, withdrawals, purchases, etc. We also dealt with POS transfers, transfers, deposits, savings. Everything. 
Now, we've split into three teams, and since late last year, I've been leading the card payments team as Principal Software Engineer. Every day, I deal with production issues and help the rest of the engineering team. 
I also handle the deployments. I work with the product manager to meet business goals and technical KPIs. One of the many perks of working here is that I have ownership of the product(s) I’m working on, so I can be very structured and put in the right processes. 
I have a team of five: two Software Engineers, two QA Engineers, and one Technical Product Manager.
The most exciting thing about my work
I absolutely love working on new features. That may seem like a no-brainer to someone else, but it's dear to my heart. We engineers sometimes struggle in companies where people do not commit much to a new feature or a change going live. 

At Moniepoint, however, we’re always forward-thinking in that aspect. Because we have as much ownership of the product as possible, this translates to commitment—to an effort, task, or a new feature. Whenever there's a new feature or a new improvement that we're going to do, I get really excited. 
Another major thing I love about my work is that it gives me the platform to advocate for best practices. I’m constantly optimising best practices and best processes to help engineers level up.
Processes need some level of PR because they have such a bad reputation. Sometimes, engineers and business people feel that implementing and enforcing processes makes progress harder. But in reality, only bad processes do that.
A good process helps things go faster. It also creates a sense of security for the participants involved, because you know you're not reinventing the wheel or going on your own.  You have the proper structures and how-tos, from the inception of a project, when it comes from business, right down to the user experience after the deployment.


My go-to framework and mental model
The most important mental model that has helped me a lot to communicate with my colleagues and also helped me set up guides for myself when implementing, is a Unified Modeling Language (UML), a language created for diagrams. 
I'm a big fan of diagrams - component diagrams, flow diagrams, and diagrams in general, because a picture, as they say, is a thousand words.
For me, a flow or sequence diagram gives my mind the same feeling as a video. I look at it and understand a lot of things that would be hard to explain in a document. Over the years, it has been really helpful for me, especially when creating user stories or presenting a new use case.
I also love how the UML started as a more technical way to describe technical documents or actual architecture classes and evolved into a tool that works across various aspects of our work, not just technical stuff—from logistics to accounting to engineering everywhere. It's a really sweet and smooth way to communicate complexities in a standardised format.
My ideology on leadership 
For me, leadership means building trust in my team, colleagues, engineers, QAs, and everyone to uphold their side of the work. Trust is very important so that we don't micromanage. Trust also leads to a feeling of safety. People perform better when they feel safe than when they feel anxious or fearful.
Trust in your team needs to be built, and it takes some time. It can be difficult with new teams, but I think trust is the biggest thing that I want to do. And it goes both ways: the team's trust in me and my trust in the team.
For fun
I mostly play music for fun. I play the guitar and bass. I used to hike when I was in my hometown, but since moving to Athens, I find it tedious to get in my car and stay in traffic to go to a mountain. It ruins the experience of the mountains or the sea for me to stay in traffic. 
So, when I want to relax, the first thing I do is pick up an instrument and play something alone to clear my mind. Sometimes, I have friends come over, and we play something together.
Moniepoint is a fast-paced and incredibly rewarding environment. If you'd like to do engineering that makes a difference, visit our careers page to join us.

Moniepoint MFB unveils new feature to combat fraud and enhance convenience. 
byBemigho Awala
Nigeria's definitive bank for small and medium-sized businesses, as well as their customers and employees, Moniepoint Microfinance Bank, has unveiled its new Unstructured Supplementary Service Data, USSD service. This service, accessible via the account control code *5573#, offers a fast, secure, and user-friendly platform for consumers to conduct their banking activities with ease, from any mobile device without the need for an internet connection. This move is expected to increase convenience and accessibility whilst showcasing the bank's commitment to financial inclusion and enhancing safety and security across the digital payment ecosystem.
The USSD Banking suite includes a variety of services such as Funds Transfer, Airtime and Data Purchase, Account Balance and Details Inquiry, PIN Management, and Account Security Measures like Blocking/Unblocking access for oneself or others. The introduction of *5573# is a security measure against unauthorised access, safeguarding customer funds in case of loss or theft of mobile phones, ATM Cards, or hardware tokens, and in situations where account details may be compromised. This code empowers customers to secure their accounts promptly from any mobile device, without needing to contact the bank, especially in cases of suspected fraud.
'At Moniepoint MFB, our top priorities are delivering exceptional customer service through digital innovation and ensuring the highest security standards,' said Babatunde Olofin, Managing Director, Moniepoint MFB. 'Our new USSD service provides the convenience of mobile banking with an added layer of security that gives customers control over protecting their accounts, even by using a third-party mobile device.'
He continued, 'We have always been guided by our mission to create a society where everyone experiences financial happiness, and in these times, what that looks like for us is increasingly empowering consumers to take charge over their bank accounts, even as we curate a seamless and secure banking experience. In addition, we have always spoken about our commitment in supporting the central bank's financial inclusion agenda. With this feature, customers, especially the least digital-savvy ones, irrespective of their location, have now been eminently positioned to carry out a wide range of transactions effortlessly.'
Existing customers, encompassing business and personal accounts, can initiate transactions and manage their accounts, by navigating to USSD Banking settings on their mobile banking app in order to activate this feature while new users will have the feature activated by default upon sign up. 
It will be recalled that in 2022, Moniepoint MFB received an award from the CBN as the most inclusive payment platform in the country. Moniepoint MFB helps over 3 million people and businesses with banking, payments processing, access to loans and business management tools with a view to powering their dreams. Moniepoint MFB has established a solid reputation for reliable service, synonymous for innovation, and a deep commitment to delivering value-added solutions in the Nigerian market.

Improving the working experience at Moniepoint through learning and development
byGabriel Balogun
From being the only one on the team when I first joined to now leading a team of 6, what a ride it has been! As I reflect on my journey with Moniepoint, I realise that the path of learning and development is about imparting knowledge and helping others find their best selves. Wondering how I got started with Moniepoint and the Learning and Development team? Let me share my story. 
My professional genesis
My passion for learning and development started during my university years, and has, over the past decade, evolved from academic roles to spearheading learning initiatives in several organisations. Before Moniepoint, I was an academic director at Utiva and played pivotal roles at [AI] Analytics Intelligence and Triciabiz, among others. These roles and experiences honed my program management and learning operations skills, setting the stage for my next big leap. 
Interestingly, I wasn’t actively applying for a job when Moniepoint contacted me.  But it was an opportunity I couldn't pass up, and I started with the team on the 21st of March, 2022. Known as TeamApt at the time, the company had already made significant strides in digitising payments for banks—a testament to its innovative spirit. What stood out to me wasn't just the role itself but the company's flexibility, openness to growth, and the chance to work alongside global minds. It was a perfect match for my aspirations and my personal mission to bring about change through learning.
Joining Moniepoint, I was faced with the challenge of creating a Learning and Development (L&D) framework from scratch. My objective was clear: to empower the workforce with the knowledge, skills and capabilities necessary to deliver their responsibilities. Drawing from my extensive experience in educational program management, instructional design, and technology, I identified three core elements essential for any learning initiative's success: technology, content, and people.
Laying the L & D foundations
The first challenge was to create a learning and development framework for a team that was rapidly evolving - the offline distribution team (also known as the offline sales team).  I had to deeply understand my 'customers' – the employees. Rather than adopting a one-size-fits-all approach with off-the-shelf learning platforms, I applied a product management lens to this task. This approach allowed me to understand the unique learning preferences and constraints of a team that was always on the move.
The end result? A custom learning platform designed to continuously upskill our distribution team without disrupting their work schedules. This wasn't only about getting the technology right; it required creating content that was engaging, accessible, and, most importantly, integrated into the team’s daily operations. 
It was designed so that all they had to do was log into their CRM tool, and it would show them the courses they were supposed to learn for the week. With a click, they could access the courses and complete the required module for the week. This straightforward method ensured they never had to go to another place to learn. 
Overcoming challenges
My next task was to build a Learning and Development (L&D) team from the ground up within a dynamic and rapidly evolving company like Moniepoint. Soon, I realised that I couldn’t handle it alone, so I hired more people to join the team. Today, the learning and development team has learning specialists, a content manager, and a creative designer. 
Another significant challenge was integrating our internal learning management system (LMS) with existing management systems. This integration was crucial for creating a seamless learning experience that aligned with the Moniepoint team's daily workflows. The challenge here was balancing my project timeline with the engineering team's availability. 
In facing these challenges, I dedicated considerable effort to deepen my understanding of Moniepoint's customers and the industry at large. In retrospect, this period of waiting and apparent inactivity was a strategic investment. It allowed me to gain insights into our team's specific needs and challenges, which made the latter L&D initiatives more targeted and impactful. This deep dive into customer and industry understanding ensured that we were better positioned to create and implement solutions that resonated deeply with our audience when the SMEs and engineering support became available.
Looking back, it's clear that these early challenges were not merely obstacles but stepping stones that enabled me to build a robust, impactful L&D framework that continues to drive Moniepoint forward.
Matching up with the evolving landscape
As Moniepoint continued to evolve, it was evident that we had to adapt and refine our Learning and Development (L&D) strategies to meet the company's shifting needs. Our metrics of success centre on adoption, engagement, and retention. Our approach focuses on treating learning initiatives as products, with distinct goals aimed at maximising our success metrics.
At the core of any L&D initiative we set up, are the Functional, Adoption, Onboarding and Growth features. The functional features ensure that every learning initiative we launch has a clear and tangible value to our employees. Adoption features ensure that there are no barriers, and every team member finds it easy to engage with learning content.  Once a team member decides to engage with an L&D initiative, the Onboarding features come into play. These features ensure learners feel supported and understand how to navigate the learning environment effectively.  Finally, we use Growth features to keep our L&D programs relevant and valuable over time. These features are designed to evolve with the learner, offering advanced content, new challenges, and opportunities for further development as they progress. 
Successfully implementing these strategies relies heavily on the right mix of technology, content, and people. The technology we choose must support the functional, adoption, onboarding, and growth features of our L&D programs, offering a seamless and accessible learning experience. The content must be relevant, engaging, and aligned with our team's needs, while the people driving these initiatives—whether L&D professionals, subject matter experts, or managers—must be committed to fostering a culture of continuous learning and development.
Our recent initiatives 
As Moniepoint grew, so did the scope of our learning initiatives. From focusing solely on the sales team, we expanded to encompass the entire organisation. This expansion was not just in breadth but depth, with our team creating specialised programs and courses tailored to various departmental needs.
By engaging directly with team managers, directors, and vice presidents, we identified critical skills and knowledge areas that could significantly enhance the performance of various teams. This led to the rapid development of courses to meet these identified needs. We also subscribed to e-learning platforms like Udemy Business and Google Cloud Skill Boost to improve learning across the company. 
Looking ahead
Our next steps include scaling our initiatives, enhancing our metrics, and, most importantly, continuing to light the path for our team to grow, innovate, and excel. The journey so far has been incredibly rewarding, and I'm excited for what lies ahead. Together, we're not just navigating the learning curve; we're redefining it.
Stepping into the role of leading and building the Learning and Development (L&D) team at Moniepoint has been a journey marked by challenges and triumphs. This role, unlike any other I've assumed before, has had a profound impact on my personal and professional growth. It has pushed me to confront my vulnerabilities, be open to learning on the fly, and be comfortable with being uncomfortable. These experiences have taught me the value of grit and the strength that lies in vulnerability. 
Professionally, the journey has been a catalyst for tremendous growth. This has not only stretched my capabilities but also refined them. It compelled me to innovate, adapt, and apply a broad spectrum of skills ranging from product management to strategic planning and team leadership. It has also deepened my understanding of how to effectively manage and inspire a team towards achieving shared goals, even in the face of uncertainty and change.
Moniepoint has moulded me into a better version of myself, and you can enjoy this character development, too. Visit our careers page now—there’s a role for you!

What’s the point of Utility bills for KYC? 
byEmmanuel Paul
Nearly everyone in the banking system faces this. You just received a huge sum of money for the first time ever, but you hit a roadblock when you try to cash out. When you go to the bank, they ask you for an updated utility bill to upgrade your account. But why? What’s the big deal with utility bills?
The answer is one of the biggest cardinal rules in finance. KYC, short for 'Know Your Customer.' It’s how banks verify who you are to prevent fraud. It's a global practice designed to keep the financial system safe for everyone. Utility bills are just one branch of KYC that verifies that you live where you say you live. To help us understand why this is important, we brought in Grace from our legal team and Glory from our Compliance and transaction monitoring team.
How KYC is structured
Know Your Customer (KYC) regulations are very important rules that financial institutions must follow to verify who their clients are. You might find this cringe, but the series of questions couples face when facing either parent for the first time? That truly captures the spirit of KYC. 
Banks and financial institutions need to know who they’re doing business with to prevent fraud and financial crimes like money laundering. KYC needs to have non-negotiable features.  


Components of KYC
Globally, KYC has three components. There can be slight variations from country to country or bank to bank but think of these components as boxes to tick before banking anyone—business or individual. They include: 
Identifying the customer: This is where the bank establishes that the customer is who they say they are. They provide documents that prove their name, address, date of birth, and nationality. For businesses, it could include things like business licenses, incorporation details, or financial statements. 
Running due diligence: Once the customer provides details, the bank needs to know what information they can trust (Risk profile). They could get additional information from private companies or public agencies and verify where they actually live. They also do the same checks for business owners. 
Ongoing monitoring: The KYC process never stops. Today's risky customer could be tomorrow's model citizen or vice versa. Banks monitor things like how often the customer moves money, the typical amount that comes in and goes out, and the customer's usual location. In some cases, banks could track political activities, sanctions, or adverse media coverage of the person or business. 
So, which documents are required? 
These documents vary from bank to bank, but you’d typically find these in Nigeria.
Proof of Name and birth:
National Identification Number (NIN), International Passport, Driver's License, Voter's Registration Card, and Bank Verification Number. 
Proof of Address: Utility Bills (Electricity, Water, Waste), rent receipt or tenancy agreement.
Others around the globe
Social security numbers
Credit history report
Tax ID
Certificate of Incorporation (Businesses)
Employment information

How Utility bills became a thing 
Even history lovers would find it hard to pinpoint an exact date when utility bills became a requirement for KYC, but we can make an educated guess. Banks have tried identifying their customers since they started 3000 years ago. However, we didn’t have formal KYC systems until a series of unchecked financial crimes from illegal activities and terrorism forced the US to enact the Bank Secrecy Act in 1970. 
In 1989, at the G7 summit in Paris, world leaders created the Financial Action Task Force (FATF). An international task force that helped create the global standard that we know today as the components of KYC.
Why utility bills? It shows two things. 

1) That you actually live where you claim to live 
2) How dutiful you are in paying your bills as of when due. 
The second is especially important if you’re applying for a loan, as it helps the bank understand your financial habits. 
The different utility bills accepted: The most popular utility bill is the Electricity Bill. Others include the water bill, waste management bill, and sometimes, the tenancy agreement or rent receipt. 
Note: In Nigeria, prepaid metres are getting more popular, and, with a few exceptions, it’s difficult to get an address when paying for tokens online. But you can easily resolve this issue by paying at a Moniepoint PoS agent close to you, and ask the agent to give you the receipt. Yeah, another important feature of PoS receipts, and you can find more in this piece. 

Even more globally: Utility bills extend to gas and phone bills in Europe, and some Asian countries also accept telephone bills. In the US, these also extend to Internet, cable, and even community association fees. 


Utility bills have some hiccups
We agree. No system is perfect. Utility bills seem like a simple solution for address verification, but they can present some challenges, especially in developing countries. Here’s what the challenges look like:
Limited Access: Imagine needing a document to prove you live somewhere, but you don't have access to the service that will give you the needed document! Millions in developing nations lack formal connections to electricity, water, or waste management, making it difficult to provide these bills as proof of address.
This could potentially exclude people from the financial sector. Thankfully, countries like Nigeria create different account tiers that don’t require you to provide a utility bill from the onset. 

Addressing system: Addressing systems in most African countries can be tricky. Imagine living in a gated community with a confusing numbering system. Worse, some places don’t have addresses, making it difficult for verification companies to pinpoint their bills' locations accurately. Without proper verification, people could bring the wrong addresses.
Cost of KYC: Complying with KYC regulations isn't free for financial institutions. It costs banks between ₦50 million to ₦400 million for KYC annually.  Also, training staff and maintaining secure data storage systems all come at a cost. A 2021 survey shows that 15 - 30% of customers who start KYC processes don’t finish the process since they find it difficult and stressful.


Keeping it secure: Best approaches to KYC
At Moniepoint, we understand the importance of KYC regulations in ensuring a safe and secure financial space for everyone. While providing a utility bill might seem simple, it's crucial to go beyond that for robust verification.
Cross-checking information: Compare customers' details with various databases to ensure consistency and identify potential discrepancies.
Additional checks: This involves working with verification partners to ensure that you actually provided the right address and not that of a friend or relative. 
Advanced algorithms: Leveraging sophisticated technology to detect unusual patterns or inconsistencies in the information provided, helping to flag suspicious activity.
Geolocation: This is particularly useful to monitor transactions, and helps loan teams or companies provide a better service for users. 
Regular updates: Fraudsters find creative ways to bypass security measures, so companies need to update their KYC processes regularly. 
At Moniepoint, we designed our KYC measures are designed to strike a balance:
A smoother experience: We strive to make the KYC process as user-friendly and efficient as possible for our customers. So you don’t abandon the sign up process midway.
Robust security: We maintain high security to protect your financial information and safeguard against fraudulent activities.
So, now you know why your bank asks you to provide light bills. It protects you, me, and everyone else. If you think KYC is a one type process, think again. So don’t get discouraged when asked to link a new identity number or provide a fresh documents. ​​

Strong cultural bonds, high levels of trust and strong cash flow: key drivers of Nigerian family businesses, Moniepoint study reveals
byBemigho Awala
Against the urgent need to deepen the Federal Government's economic agenda - financial inclusion, job and wealth creation and fiscal growth, the critical role played by family businesses as the heartbeat of Nigeria's economy has once again been spotlighted and thrust into sharp focus. Africa’s leading digital financial services provider, Moniepoint Inc, has released its latest case study – How Families Power Nigeria’s Economy, a reflective chronicle of how the legacy of family businesses, from centennial conglomerates to bustling local eateries, are a living narrative and solid testament to Nigeria's entrepreneurial spirit.
It will be recalled that the Special Adviser to the President on Presidential Enabling Business Environment Council (PEBEC) and Investment, Dr Jumoke Oduwole recently revealed that there are approximately 23.8 million family businesses, responsible for millions of jobs, dispersed throughout the country, and collectively they contribute around $200 billion annually into the nation’s economy. Closely aligned to this disclosure is the oft-stated data that with over 40 million micro, small and medium enterprises (MSMEs) contributing nearly 50% of the national GDP; accounting for over 84% of total employment as well as 96% of businesses in Nigeria. These figures reflect the glaring significance and the impact that family businesses have on Nigeria’s economy.
According to the Moniepoint study, which provides deep insights into what has kept these businesses going across generations, how they navigate challenges, and opportunities for growth and innovation, more than half of Nigerian family businesses don’t have strong digital capabilities, with very few seeing it as a priority area. The lack of clear governance and business management structures, as well as poor succession planning, are some of the challenges that undermine the scalability of family businesses in Nigeria. 
Key drivers that undergird a lot of these enterprises include, strong cash flow with a view to ensuring that they remain profitable, high levels of trust driven by shared vision and business objectives and cohesive cultural bonds where one out of every two Nigerian businesses bear the distinction of being a family business. 
Furthermore, the study avers that the story of Nigerian family businesses is one of resilience, adaptation, and enduring legacy. It posits furthermore that the future of Nigerian family businesses is bright with potential even as more enterprises embrace the tools and strategies for success in a digital age, supported by innovative driven solution partners. It contends that as they evolve, family businesses will remain at the heart of Nigeria's economic and cultural identity, powering the nation's economy and shaping its future for future generations while ushering in a new era of growth, sustainability, and global competitiveness.
Speaking to the rationale behind this latest study, Vice President of Communications and Public Relations, Moniepoint Inc, Edidiong Didi Uwemakpan noted that the decision to focus on family businesses was driven by their significant contributions to Nigeria’s economy despite their varying sizes and sectors.
'At Moniepoint, we pride ourselves on being more than just a financial services provider; we are an astute partner to business owners, helping them to be financially happy while ensuring that our innovative solutions power the dreams of these enterprises. We believe that the growth of family businesses directly supports the entire economy, which in turn essentially extends our ability to positively impact everyone else, which aligns with our brand's mission,' she said. 
Stating Moniepoint’s commitment to helping these businesses embrace digitisation, 'Our services have helped several family-owned businesses improve their operations through simplified payment collection, cash flow management, and access to capital. Our recent partnership with the CAC will further catalyse technology adoption for these businesses while providing a foundation for them to adopt better record-keeping, financial reporting and governance practices which are pivotal for their efficiency, productivity and long-term viability, and also drive market access and trade facilitation into regional and global value chains for them.'
In 2023, Moniepoint MFB, was honoured with the prestigious Rising Star Family Business Award in recognition of the giant strides made by the firm over the years and their contribution to the Nigerian economy at the Businessday, My Family My Business, and PwC Nigeria Family Business Summit.

From Technical Writer to Cyber Security Analyst: Is That a Technically Secure Transition?
byEmmanuel Okorie
Forgive this title, but if you’re reading it, something sure got your attention, and I hope I can keep that attention till the end. 
Now, where do I start? 
My name is Emmanuel, and I work as an IT Governance Risk and Compliance Analyst at Moniepoint. I have many 'how it started versus how it’s going' stories, but I’ll focus on my growth across teams here at Moniepoint. Yes, I said across teams. Typically, people grow within a team, but in my case, I switched teams, and here’s how that happened.
The journey to Moniepoint
As a kid, my dream was to study either medicine or computer science. Reading the book 'Gifted Hands' automatically sealed the medicine path for me. I did everything possible to achieve that dream, including travelling to Ukraine to study. 
For whatever reason, I did not think about what it meant in its entirety and by my third year in medical school, I realised that I had an aversion to seeing blood. I remember witnessing a session in the theatre one day, and I couldn’t just go on. That day, I started considering my options.
A few weeks later, I packed my 'Best Student of the Year' award (which I had won twice), and returned to Nigeria to pursue my other dream - computer science. After completing my study in Computer Science, I got an opportunity to work with GTbank as a graduate trainee. After 6 months of training, the department realised I had a skill for documenting product processes. So, I was drafted to the business analysis and solutions architecture team. 
One of my highlights working there was when we had staff members from Moniepoint (then TeamApt) come around for meetings. We were one of the vendors for whom TeamApt had built a core banking system, and every time we had sessions with the people from TeamApt, I always found myself admiring the level of work they were delivering. Deep down, I knew I wanted to work here, even if I wasn’t an engineer. So, even when I left the bank to help a start-up build a new product, my eyes were still set on the goal, and the moment an opportunity came to join the team, I jumped at it. 
What has Technical Writing got to do with Security and Risk Assessment?
Even while studying medicine, I loved to break processes down and look for areas that fascinated me. When I joined Moniepoint as a Technical Writer, my favourite part was documenting the whole software development cycle. I was so into writing that I started paying attention to areas I thought needed extra attention, one of them being security.
As my interest grew, I fanned them to flames and eventually went to the UK to study Security threat Intelligence and Forensics. All this while, I was still a Technical Writer at Moniepoint. About a year into my studies, I started looking for opportunities to apply what I was learning and that’s when I found out that we were hiring for that role internally. I applied to join our Cyber security team and got it!
A new path: expectations vs responsibilities
One would think it’d be easy to switch from technical writing to cyber security since I had a Master’s Degree in Security threat. Still, I’ve realised that theories have no place near practicals or, should I say, reality. Thankfully, we have a great onboarding system that helped me transition easily.
My team lead, Albert, was always available to help, and he didn’t leave any stone unturned when showing me the rings. I was well settled in a few weeks and could apply my knowledge. One of the reasons I love our 4Ms framework is how it hits the nail on the head. Mastery is my favourite motivation here because I have seen multiple opportunities to apply my skills and improve. I have a very supportive team, and when I work with other departments to ensure all loose ends are tied, the technical depth is so evident that you just learn something new. 


If I kept your attention until this point, then you’re probably interested in joining the team. I think you should push that interest by checking for an open role that suits you.

I love the scientific process behind working with Data - Habib
byGbemi Adekanmbi
Every day at Moniepoint, we process over 750 million transactions monthly, leveraging data to provide financial happiness to users across our business and personal banking products.
In this lightning round, Habib, our Data Engineering Lead, breaks down why he loves working with data and how he got into data engineering.
What led you to Moniepoint?
I got into tech while I was still in university, studying mechanical engineering. I used to work on drones, so I learned to code because I wanted to build drones that could fly themselves. This main motivation to learn how to build drones, over time, evolved into something I enjoyed.
Tosin, Moniepoint’s CEO, came to deliver a lecture at OAU around the time I was getting immersed in programming. I was not at the lecture, but people told me about it and how good it was. This registered Moniepoint (then TeamApt) in my mind, and I was fascinated. 

A few days later, someone shared a vacancy at Moniepoint. I applied and went through the interview, and that's how I got into Moniepoint four years ago. Towards the end of 2019, I returned to school for my Masters degree and rejoined the company afterwards. 

Can you think of anything you've enjoyed working on in the last year?
The most interesting thing I've worked on recently is this data pipeline for our business loans product. I worked on a data pipeline that gathers our data from all our data sources, harmonises the data, and presents it in a way the product can understand.
That's the largest data set I've worked with, so it was challenging getting it to work. If you have a very large data set it can take days to process if you don't do things the right way. So the challenge was to make it run as fast as possible, and achieve something workable and usable by the product.
If you were to describe your role as a type of food, what would it be?
My role as a data engineer is like ponmo (ponmo refers to cow skin, a favourite beef part enjoyed as a side dish, snack and condiment in southwestern Nigeria). Yes, I'll compare it to ponmo, and the reason I'm describing it that way is because sometimes it's soft work, and sometimes it's so tough, it almost blows your teeth dry. 
What’s one weird challenge you’ve dealt with?
One of the main challenges I have at work is talking to or maybe reaching out to people. You see, I’m incredibly shy, and if I absolutely have to reach out to someone, I might think about it for an hour before making the move. Sometimes, I will just talk to a person I already have a rapport with to help me talk to the person. 
But with time, I've been getting better at reaching out to people.
What’s your favourite M, in the 4Ms Framework?
Out of the four M's the one that resonates with me the most is mastery. And that's because whenever I take something or start working on something new I'm not always satisfied with just being ordinary. I always want to take it to the next level.
At least be the at least best or the closest to being the best at doing that thing. So it's mastery. If I wasn't a data engineer I'd probably be a university professor. I might still become one in the future. 
What do you love most about working with Data?
What I love about working with data is that data doesn't lie. It's pretty much the way a scientist makes hypotheses.
You have a question, conduct research, establish your hypothesis, then run an experiment to verify whether your hypothesis is true, and analyse the results. 
Working with data is similar to that. You can hypothesise that on Fridays, you're likely to make more money because of a couple of conditions or events. Then you work with and check your data, you run your analysis and find out, 'Oh okay, it's not actually Friday', maybe it's Mondays you're supposed to make more money.
So, just like the scientific process, you make a hypothesis, and you verify your hypothesis.
If you found this fascinating, you should check out the video version, and stop by our careers page to see our open roles.

Moniepoint commemorates IWD with call for applications into 4th edition of Women in Tech Programme 
byBemigho Awala
The role of women and their centrality to the growth and evolution of technology has been widely acknowledged. Yet, recent statistics show that women remain underrepresented in the technology industry. The last census results by the National Population Commission show that there are almost as many women as there are men in Nigeria, however data from the Nigerian Bureau of Statistics (NBS) on women and men in the country reveal that women occupy just 25% of the employment rate in the technology industry even as 22% of annual STEM graduates from Nigerian universities are women. Although a global challenge, these gaps have underscored the need to increase female representation in the tech industry in Nigeria.
As the world marks the 2024 International Women’s Day, IWD and against the backdrop of the successful execution of its three previous editions, leading digital financial services provider for emerging markets and the second-fastest growing company in Africa, Moniepoint Inc has announced the launch of this year’s edition of the Women-In-Tech initiative. This year’s IWD campaign theme of #InspireInclusion calls for action to break down barriers, challenge stereotypes, and create environments where all women are valued and respected.
Given that previous editions had 5 women in each cohort, this year the 6-month internship programme which is aimed at ensuring that young women have access to building a career in technology will see 10 women take on roles in various teams that include Cloud Engineering, Backend Engineering, Technical Product Management, Data Engineering, Systems Administration, Technical Support and User Experience. Christened as the Dream 10, these women will be provided with direct mentorship during the internship. Other perks include; a salary, work tools, merch, the opportunity to work on live projects during the course of the internship and an offer of full-time employment depending on assessment post-internship.
The goal of the Women in Tech initiative has always been to provide women with the opportunity to grow their skills by gaining the necessary experience to advance their careers. As such, selected applicants get to spend time working on real projects to help shape digital finance in Africa. Alumni from the programme have become active contributors to the development of their products making a huge difference in the world while making significant strides within the tech ecosystem.
Speaking on this year’s edition, Chinaza Nduka-Dike, Head, People Operations at Moniepoint Inc noted that with this initiative the organization is going over and beyond inspiring inclusion to demonstrating a genuine commitment to making a difference in the lives of women. 
'Increasingly we are seeing that diversity, inclusion can ignite innovation and growth. Intentional outreaches such as our Women in Tech which have helped to increase female representation and have had a transformative power to create meaningful inclusion while ensuring that we can keep pace with the talent development in a global economy. We have been able to fill talent gaps while giving women great jobs and a sustainable livelihood. Looking back at the past editions, we are filled with an immense sense of pride at the progress made and looking forward to adding more women to the pool who in turn can grow as leaders and build thriving, successful organizations', she said.
Tefe Oladejo, a frontend engineer and member of the pioneer cohort of the Moniepoint Women in Tech expressed her delight at the increased number of internship roles available for the 2024 programme.
'I am a living witness to the transformative power of bold action initiatives like this. It’s been a privilege to work on products that you can see making a visible difference in the lives of millions. Moniepoint’s supportive ecosystem has been very pivotal to my growth and personal development,' she said.
Since 2019, Moniepoint’s technology has powered the dreams of over 2 million business and individuals, offering personal and business banking, payment, credit and business management tools to help them succeed. 
The internship is open to women across Africa who are interested in starting a career in technology. Interested applicants can find out more about available roles and apply for the programme via the Women in Tech website, https://womenintech.moniepoint.com

Let's explore the simple steps to follow.
What is your National Identity Number?
Your National Identity Number (NIN) is an 11-digit number assigned to you when you complete enrollment into the National Identity Database (NIDB). This unique number is randomly generated and given to individuals aged zero and above. 
Financial institutions such as Moniepoint MFB use your NIN to confirm your records in the database and verify your identity. 
You can easily enrol for your NIN at any verified enrollment NIMC Enrolment Centre with any of the required original and valid supporting documents such as your BVN, driver's license, voter's card, etc.
Getting Onboarded to your Moniepoint Personal Banking Account using your National Identity Number
You can open a Moniepoint Personal Banking account in minutes using your NIN and verify your identity at different KYC levels. Follow the steps below:

If the displayed details do not belong to you, you can input your NIN and click 'Next'. You can also dial the code *346# on your registered phone number for a network service fee of N20 if you can’t remember your NIN, 
You will be required to carry out a face verification to confirm if an actual person is opening the account and to verify that your picture matches that on your NIN database. You will be presented with prompts on the steps to follow. Click on 'Proceed'. Properly position your face in the oval and smile for a camera capture.
Once you confirm that the image is of good quality, click 'Yes, use this' and 'Continue' until you see the identity verified screen. Note that if your image does not match that on your NIN, you can retry verification.
After this, you will be asked to provide other KYC level one upgrading verification, such as your residential address and attestation.

5 Challenges Women Entrepreneurs Face in Starting and Growing Their Businesses in Nigeria
byChidinma Nwonye
Entrepreneurship, which is the process of setting up a business to make a profit, is essential for the economic growth of a country. 
In Nigeria, the entrepreneurial field has created many opportunities like career growth, innovation, and increased national income. 
However, as promising as this field sounds, there is a noticeable gap in the ratio of male-to-female entrepreneurship success in Nigeria. 
According to data from the Small and Medium Enterprise Development Agency of Nigeria, women participate primarily in the informal sector at 42.1%. 
With a staggering representation of just 13.57% in the formal business sector as opposed to their male counterparts of 86.43%, some factors hinder the success of women's entrepreneurship in Nigeria. 
From limited funding opportunities to a lack of networking opportunities, etc, let's explore some challenges women entrepreneurs face in Nigeria and how they can overcome them. 
Key Takeaways
The 2024 International Women's Day Theme is 'Invest in Women: Accelerate Progress.'
'Nigeria ranks low on the gender gap parity, ranking 123 (with a score of 0.639) out of 146 countries. Women continue to experience deficits in decent work related to the business and regulatory environment and access to financial and business development services critical in formalising and growing their businesses' (National Gender Policy, 2021).
'According to the results from the Women Entrepreneurs Survey (WES) undertaken under this research study and supported by evidence from the National MSME survey 2021, women have a high level of interest in becoming entrepreneurs but face challenges related to the business and regulatory environment, including access to financial and business development services critical to formalising and growing their businesses.'
Networking can aid women entrepreneurs in accessing funding, valuable knowledge, and partnerships, which are crucial for the growth and success of their businesses.
Digital solutions like Moniepoint MFB's business banking app can ease banking processes, allowing women entrepreneurs to manage their finances and strike a work-family balance efficiently.
By leveraging digital marketing tools, women entrepreneurs can combat the challenges of limited market access and create a strong foothold in the market.
Challenges Women Entrepreneurs Face in Nigeria
Women entrepreneurs in Nigeria often face challenges when setting up and growing their businesses. Some of them include;

#1. Limited Access to Finance
Limited access to finances to fuel their business is a significant limitation women face when growing their businesses. Most women rely heavily on personal finances when starting, which can ultimately become insufficient in the long run. 
In addition to the limited funds, some women face obstacles like financial illiteracy and ignorance, which limit their chances of accessing funds for their business ventures. 
The National Bureau of Statistics in Nigeria states that about 80% of women-owned enterprises fund their businesses from their finances due to difficulties accessing external funding. 
Women can combat this challenge by exploring alternative funding opportunities such as business loans, business savings accounts, financial awareness training, etc. 
(Source) 


#2. Insufficient Access to Networking Opportunities
A strong professional network is vital for success in entrepreneurship; however, most women only sometimes access such networks. As a result of these limited networks, they often get limited access to capital expansion, mentors, etc., which can boost their business growth. 
Women in today's age can overcome this limitation by attending business seminars and industry events and connecting to industry experts on platforms like LinkedIn. The rise in technological advancement also gives women an edge in business. 
This is where they can leverage tech upskilling internships like the Women in Tech internship by Moniepoint MFB. 
#3. Balancing Business and Family Responsibilities
A major challenge facing women entrepreneurs in Nigeria is the need to balance household responsibilities as caretakers and businesses. To overcome this, women can hire household helpers, seek support from friends and families, delegate business tasks, and prioritise tasks. 
Digital financial institutions like Moniepoint MFB make it easy for women to handle their financial needs by providing convenient personal and business banking solutions. This way, women entrepreneurs can run their e-commerce businesses, for instance, without the stress of physical visits to banking institutions. 
#4. Limited Access to Customers and Markets
Due to limited access to markets and clients, some women entrepreneurs face challenges in growing and profiting from their businesses.
Limiting access to profitable markets, national or local, comes from insufficient market information and the inability to scale up and enhance their competitiveness (often due to scarce resources). 
Other factors include limited capacity building, poor product quality, limited access to Information and communication technologies (ICT) tools or skills, or inadequate market integration.
Ultimately, the small size of employees in women-owned businesses creates a barrier to their participation in international markets where volume is a major requirement. 
The limited market access can further hinder businesswomen from achieving a broader customer base and boosting their businesses efficiently. Women can overcome this challenge by leveraging digital marketing tools, websites, and social media platforms to target specific audiences and increase their online presence.

#5. Social and Cultural Barriers
Societal and traditional practices in some tribes of the country restrict women's access to economic opportunities, property rights, land inheritance, and use. For example, the Land Use Act offers equal access to land ownership; however, some social customs or regions present contrary practices. 
These factors pose a challenge to women entrepreneurs, thereby impacting their business growth potential. To overcome these barriers, women can advocate for gender equality by actively participating in movements that promote women's empowerment. 
Innovating Trends and Opportunities for Women Entrepreneurs
The Emergence of Technology-driven Businesses: Women entrepreneurs are making a mark in launching innovative startups and digital platforms. For example, Damilola Olokesusi, the co-founder and CEO of a Nigerian transportation startup, Shuttlers, Oyindamola Honey Ogundeyi, the founder of Fashpa.com, a Nigerian e-commerce site, etc
Growth of Social Enterprises: Women entrepreneurs like Sandra Chukwudozie, a Nigerian female entrepreneur and clean energy activist, are addressing societal challenges through social enterprises. 
The Power of Collaboration and Networking: Women-focused networks and mentorship programs empower entrepreneurs.
Access to Financial Inclusion and Funding: Financial institutions like Moniepoint MFB are developing tailored digital banking products to support women-owned businesses.
Upcoming Opportunities in Agribusiness: Agribusinesses offer many opportunities for women entrepreneurs in Nigeria.
Retail and e-Commerce Growth: The retail industry, specifically e-commerce, is booming in Nigeria thanks to technological innovation. This provides women with a fairer competing ground to execute their business operations.
Wellness and Health Entrepreneurship: Women are delving into fitness, healthcare products and services, wellness coaching, etc.
Final Words
Once viewed as a man's field in Nigeria, entrepreneurship has since evolved to include women, thus embracing the 2024 International Women's Day theme 'Invest in Women: Accelerate Progress.' 
At Moniepoint, we believe in financial inclusivity for everyone, regardless of gender. By leveraging our digital banking solutions, more Nigerian women can access convenient and reliable business and personal banking solutions to boost their ventures.

From Investor to Operator: Peter’s Path to Moniepoint 
byChidinma Enemanna
I’m usually fascinated by people taking unconventional leaps, and even though this is a bit common at Moniepoint, it is nonetheless interesting. Interesting enough that I believe it deserves a blog post of its own. 
One of such stories is that of our VP of Mergers & Acquisitions. Peter Oriaifo used to be an investor in Moniepoint - yes, you read that right. A pretty early investor who believed in our vision. Today, many years later, Peter is driving our growth and expansion from within. 
Naturally, I sat down with him to understand why he moved. Peter’s career has always been at the intersection of finance and technology in unexpected but profoundly impactful ways, and in the next few minutes, you’ll find out how.
Hi Peter, let’s take it back to the beginning. How did your career start off?
Hi Chidinma. Younger me was fascinated with technology; you would usually find me dismantling computers for fun. This led me towards being a computer science major.
However, an internship in finance unexpectedly veered my path towards the financial sector. This decision was not a departure from my tech roots but an expansion, blending my understanding of coding with the financial world.
Post-graduation, I ventured into the financial services sector, influenced by an uncle who was in the Nigerian banking sector. My time at a boutique investment bank was instrumental in refining my expertise in growth strategies, acquisitions, and mergers, particularly within the community banking sphere. Here, I was a part of historic transactions, including handling the acquisition of JIKO by a fintech company, marking the first fintech acquisition of a bank in U.S. history—a testament to being at the right place at the right time. Witnessing another acquisition - Radius Bank's by Lending Club, helped seal my excitement for this path. 
I tried out becoming a product manager but ultimately started off as a consultant, when I couldn’t land a role. I specialised in evaluation and growth strategies for high-growth tech and life science companies. During this period, a lot of fintech companies came to my plate. One of them was Toast, which gave a foundational prep to what working in Moniepoint would be like as they share some similarities. 
Sounds like equal parts fun and intense hard work. Let’s talk about investing in Moniepoint. How did that happen?
It certainly was a lot of work; but I had to learn, so I was happy to do the work. I knew I wanted to do more in the African tech space, and it was a delight to join the  Oui Capital team to do this. Our early investment in Moniepoint was not just a financial decision but a belief in the company's vision to redefine banking for the Nigerian consumer. My role transcended mere investment; it was about nurturing and supporting an ecosystem where every startup's success story is a collective victory.
Aha. That’s brief but packed. So why did you choose to do the work from within?
Joining Moniepoint as VP of Mergers and Acquisitions speaks to my belief in the company and commitment to driving sustainable growth within the African tech ecosystem, particularly at a juncture marked by ‘funding winters’ and economic volatility. Today, as I witness Moniepoint's influence from local markets to family gatherings, my conviction in the path we're carving for financial inclusivity and empowerment in Africa only strengthens.
Moniepoint, with its extensive resources and strategic position within the market, emerged as the perfect platform for me to execute this vision. The company stands at the forefront of the ecosystem's consolidation, offering a beacon of hope and a pathway for businesses facing adversity. My role in M&A is pivotal in this context, enabling Moniepoint to bolster its own growth while assisting other companies in gracefully concluding their stories or embarking on new chapters.
…but why Moniepoint specifically?
Moniepoint ticks the box for me in a lot of ways. Some of the reasons why I decided to join Moniepoint include: 
Impact on small businesses: The work at Moniepoint significantly supports small businesses, and I find this important and fulfilling. The impact is a driving force for me, emphasising the company’s role in fostering economic growth and empowerment at the grassroots level. One instance that stands out for me is Moniepoint’s critical role during the cash crunch period, where it served as a lifeline for many businesses in Nigeria. The ability to make a tangible difference during challenging times reinforces my belief in the company’s mission and its importance to the community. 
Company's Trajectory: Moniepoint's rapid growth and the dynamic nature of its business also excite me a lot. I see working at Moniepoint as an opportunity to accelerate a career within a fast-paced, ever-evolving environment that continues to grow in importance and impact. The quality of talent at Moniepoint, across all levels, stands out to me. I’m inspired by the people I work with, including specific colleagues like Habib, a data engineer whose skill and work ethic is outstanding.
Company culture and environment: The phenomenal work culture at Moniepoint makes it a vibrant and enjoyable workplace. The remote work dynamic at Moniepoint is particularly attractive, especially in the post-pandemic world where the concept of work has evolved. I appreciate that the organisation doesn’t confine productivity to a traditional office environment. It allows for a more balanced and enjoyable approach to work. 
Enough of the serious side of you for a minute. What’s life like outside of work?
Outside the walls of mergers and acquisitions, I’m an avid collector of African art in general. I have a deep appreciation for culture and heritage. You will find me collecting, going to, and visiting African art exhibitions. 
I also have a love for music and travelling, as I have a curious mind and am open to new experiences. I would love to visit Marrakech as my next destination as I’ve heard a lot about the country and its tourist scene.
Marrakech is certainly a vibe. Thank you for speaking with me, Peter. It’s been a pleasure. 
If you made it this far. Thank you for reading. With every new challenge and opportunity, we're not just changing the game at Moniepoint; we're redefining it. But here's the thing— we’re always looking for more stories like this. Moniepoint is on the lookout for curious minds, passionate hearts, and daring spirits who believe in making a real difference.
If that sounds like you, join us at Moniepoint. Let's innovate, impact, and inspire together. Your next big adventure awaits!

Nicolaas’s path to research-led technical product management at Moniepoint.
byNicolaas Taljaard
I have a PhD in researching and finding things out. Okay, not an actual PhD, but a curiosity that drives me to understand, in-depth, the nuances of any problem I’m working on, and burrow into the possibilities and solutions that may be applied to the problem. This has, over time, helped me develop a keen sense of technical experimentation, failing fast, and applying practical solutions, all leading to a life of Product. 
This short piece is an attempt to take you into how I became this research nerd today, and how it’s shaped my career.
Let me go back to the beginning.
When I was a tad younger and trying to shape my career, I was bent on studying Architecture but couldn’t seem to navigate my way into it, so I ended up doing project management. I had assumed studying architecture was the optimal way to explore my passion for designing and building things and seeing them come to life.
Eventually, I decided that my love for intricacies and design could be fulfilled by studying computer science. I, therefore, went back to school to study Computer Science! I fell in love with the design and principles behind how computers work, how the Software Development Cycle works, and how to solve problems. 
My first job was at a mobile payments company, in their Research & Development(R&D) department as a junior engineer. And I’m pretty sure that was how my obsession with research kicked in. Soon, I was working directly with the head of R&D on both the hardware and the software side, building prototypes for what we saw was needed in the market. 

When I left that company,  a couple of us came together to run a business. I ran the technical aspects, honing my love of research and development and answering the question, 'How do we solve a problem most optimally?' 
I then went on to consult for various startups trying to build products that needed market and architecting solutions to achieve their MVP. Those were the first 6-7 years of my career. 
Arriving at this (Monie)point
After the first 7 years, I evolved into core systems and startup architecture (yay, architecture). I’ve therefore spent time on the board of a few startups, where I served as an advisor. My role involved guiding their roadmaps; what products to use, and how to design their system using open-source and cloud-hosted technologies.
I went on to be a systems architect at a very up-and-coming IoT business in Africa that was owned by Vodafone; optimising what they had and how to future-proof the solution for the next five to ten years. 
I did this until I saw the call to join Moniepoint as Technical Product Manager, R&D. I found it exciting and decided to join the team.
Life as an R&D Technical Product Manager
My current role as technical product manager in R&D is to coordinate and build out solutions that will create new products for the business. I’m also looking to solve current growing pains that none of the departments can solve by themselves, which affects the entire business as a whole. 
For example, one problem that we're working on now is solving a pain across the entire organisation and no one has time to actually concentrate and focus on it. The other is building a completely new business unit. 
So, between my VP and I, we work hard in researching and carving out new markets, to push the business into new areas while also solving issues that have held different departments back from achieving their goals. It sounds a bit tricky swinging between these two major bull’s eyes, but that’s the crux of what we need to do.
Why R&D?
Now, you’re probably wondering why my obsession with Research is unrelenting, and I’ve decided it's because of the rapid prototyping approach that it gives me. I'm a big fan of the fast approach to building things - try something, try it quickly, and if it works, then perfect; if it doesn't work, can it and find something else.
I have an inbuilt mental model premised on the process - 'don't be afraid of failing, but if you fail, make sure you fail fast, don't waste a lot of resources trying to prototype something'. 
That mental model, combined with my academic perspective getting honours in artificial intelligence and the research that went into that. I enjoy applying throughout any kind of product that I design and figuring out what would be the best principles to apply while achieving the goal in the shortest time.
Looking ahead - what impact do I want my work to make?
I would love my contribution to have made a dramatic change in how the business operates and the products we can deliver as a whole in quality, robustness, and scalability. 
As a bank, we need to deal with vast amounts of data with pen testing security issues, all of which play a role in what my products need to solve and protect against. I therefore want to look back one year from now and be excited about all the problems I’ve solved across departments and company-wide.
What do I do when I’m not geeking out on Products or GTM strategies?
I have a 4x4 vehicle that I take out to obstacle courses with my friends and see how far we can push the car before damaging it. We're a group of friends, usually doing four to ten cars that then tackle the obstacle course and see how far we get.
In addition to this, I play golf a lot! 😅😅

You’ve read Nicolaas’ curiosity-driven career path. We’re always hiring people who are driven by problem-solving and curiosity. If that sounds like you, join us at Moniepoint.

Moniepoint's General Counsel, Others, Named in Legal 500's Inaugural GC Powerlist for Nigeria
byBemigho Awala
The GC Powerlist: Nigeria recognises the most influential and innovative in-house counsel driving significant change within Nigeria's leading companies. As the first edition focused solely on Nigeria, it spotlights standout general counsels navigating complex regulatory environments and advancing their organizations through technological transformation.
Every year, the Legal 500 invites law firm partners and in-house counsels to nominate in-house lawyers who have been instrumental in driving their organisations and businesses forward. In-house lawyers are especially recognised for changing or forming commercial opinions; developing outstanding technical solutions to complex issues; creating innovative structures to ensure that the in-house legal function is supporting and driving the business; and providing business working models that other in-house counsels can follow.
The Legal 500 has been analysing the capabilities of law firms and in-house lawyers across the world, with a comprehensive research program revised and updated every year to bring the most up-to-date vision of the global legal market. The Legal 500 assesses the strengths of law firms and in-house lawyers in over 150 jurisdictions, the results of which can be viewed free of charge. Research is based on feedback from 300,000 clients worldwide, submissions from law firms and interviews with leading private practice lawyers, and a team of researchers who have unrivalled experience in the legal space.
Speaking, Lead Researcher, GC Powerlist: Nigeria 2024, Funke Olufon expressed her true delight at introducing this inaugural edition, after previous years of covering Africa in its entirety. 
'This inaugural edition not only showcases the landmark cases and impressive deals undertaken by these deserving legal professionals. Interviews conducted in this Powerlist present truly varied and thought-provoking perspectives on a gamut of issues, among which include a shared focus on leading a digital transformation in legal departments and processes; the race to align Nigeria’s compliance requirements with international standards; and the efforts being made to refurbish the legal department’s reputation to that of true business partners,' she said. 
Notable legal professionals that made the cut include Moniepoint's General Counsel, Okechukwu Eke; Adesua Dozie, Vice chairman, General Counsel, Mobil Producing Nigeria; Chidi Momah, General Counsel and Company Secretary, NNPC; Dr. Irene Robinson-Ayanwale, General Counsel and Divisional Head, Business Support Services, NGX Group; Ifedayo Lawal, Senior Director, Legal Africa, Coca-Cola Nigeria; Michael Otu, General Counsel and Company Secretary, Zenith Bank and Oluseye Alayande, Group Chief Legal Officer and Company Secretary, BUA Group among others.
Speaking to his inclusion in the prestigious list, Okechukwu Eke noted that Moniepoint’s legal team has been involved in a number of key initiatives, including the implementation of a contract management platform which has resulted in some significant benefits. 'We have developed standardised agreements for Moniepoint’s products and services, contributing to our recognition and ranking as one of Africa’s fastest-growing companies.'
On the use of AI in day-to-day legal work, Okechukwu opined that 'the AI feature has played a crucial role in enhancing efficiency within our legal team’s contract management process. It has significantly reduced the time spent on reviewing and drafting contracts, enabling team members to focus on more complex and strategic assignments. Furthermore, it has enhanced the efficiency of contract reviews by assisting in the elimination of errors during the review process, and it consistently improves negotiating outcomes.'
The GC Powerlist: Nigeria 2024 showcases the fascinating stories and perspectives of the most exceptional, richly deserving in-house counsels Nigeria has to offer, and see how legal professionals continue to innovatively drive their companies forward, while skillfully navigating the nuances of the Nigerian economic landscape.
Since the launch of the Legal 500 Powerlist in 2013, 3,000 individuals, 2,000 teams and 100+ law firms have been recognised for inclusion in 38 regions and countries across the world (also known as jurisdictional lists).

What’s the point of increasing the MPR?
byEmmanuel Paul
MPR. CRR. BLR. What are these terms?
Over the past few months, the prices of goods and services have been climbing so high, they're practically giving everyone headaches. It's a tough pill to swallow for everyone in Nigeria, from the person pricing tomatoes to big businesses budgeting for the next quarter. 
The Central Bank of Nigeria (CBN) has decided to step into the ring to save us all, by tweaking the monetary policy rate. This article looks to break things down, but let’s have the raw facts. 
The CBN has increased the MPR by 400 basis points from 18.75% to a record high of 22.75%. 
The cash reserve ratio (CRR) has increased from 32.5% to 45%
The bank liquidity ratio remains at 30%
The asymmetric corridor is at +200/-700 basis points of the MPR. 
This is a lot, but there’s good news. We talked with Bayo, our Chief Financial Officer, who broke things down for us, so we can do the same for you. 
First, let’s break it down…
We know you’re not 5. But that doesn’t mean the terms might be less confusing. To understand what these recent policy adjustments mean, there are a few terms you need to get. Let’s break down what these big finance terms mean:
1. Monetary Policy Rate (MPR):
What it is: The MPR is the benchmark interest rate set by the CBN, which influences the cost of borrowing in the country. The increase of 400 basis points just means the interest rate increased by 4% (why didn’t they just say so, right? I know). 
What this means for you: It means that the lowest you can get charged for interest is higher now. With the previous MPR, banks charged between 25% - 30% interest. Now, it could get as high as 35%.
That sounds scary, yes. But it can be a good thing. A higher MPR also means that banks can give you higher interest rates on your savings. It could move from the typical 10% to 15%. Sweet.
2. Cash Reserve Ratio (CRR):
What it is: The CRR is the percentage of a bank's deposits that must be kept with the CBN as a reserve. At an MPR of 45%, for every 100 naira a customer keeps with a bank, the bank must keep 45 naira with the CBN. This money cannot be used for lending or any other purposes.
What this means for you: With the CRR increased to 45%, banks have less money to lend. While it becomes more difficult for businesses and individuals to get loans to do anything, it also means less cash in circulation, which is good for tackling inflation.

3. Bank Liquidity Ratio:
What it is: This is simply the amount of money or assets a bank must hold compared to its total deposits. This can be either cash in the bank or assets like government bonds that can be quickly converted to cash if needed. The purpose is to ensure banks can promptly meet customers' withdrawal demands. 
What this means for you: Maintaining the liquidity ratio at 30% ensures that banks remain stable and can cover withdrawals by customers. This means that your deposits are safer, but conversely affects how much banks can lend to you.
4. The Asymmetric Corridor:
What it is: This is the rate at which the CBN either lends to or borrows from banks, with the MPR rate of 22.75% as a starting point. If the bank has excess cash and decides to lend to the CBN, the apex bank says it will borrow at MPR - 700 basis points (15.75%). If the bank needs cash urgently, the CBN then lends at MPR + 200 (24.75%)
What this means for you: This adjustment gives the CBN more control over interest rates and discourages banks from borrowing money from or lending to the CBN.
Why's the CBN doing this? The big picture.
So, disclaimer: we’re not the CBN. But since World War II, global central banks have used Monetary Policies or something related to regulate inflation. Now, why has the CBN implemented these specific changes?
Reduced inflation
The primary aim of raising the MPR is to curb inflation by slowing down money circulation. Higher borrowing costs mean businesses and consumers will likely borrow less and spend less.

Nigeria’s inflation rate as of December 2023 was 28.92% and goods and services have become super expensive. With the higher MPR, a bottled water business, for example, might initially raise prices to cover the higher costs of repaying their loans. Then, the overall demand for that bottled water is expected to decrease as consumers become more cautious about spending. 

This reduced demand could decrease inflation over time, as businesses may be forced to lower prices to encourage customers to buy stuff. Since 2022, over 45 countries have increased interest rates to fight inflation.
Increased control over money in supply
Increasing the CRR helps control the money supply more directly. With banks required to keep a larger portion of their deposits at the CBN, there's less money available for lending, aiming to temper inflation and stabilise the flow of the naira.

Interestingly, some banks already operate at higher than 45% reserve, and others operate lower than the previous 30%. The CBN is now trying to harmonise everything to 45%. 
Adjusting the Asymmetric Corridor
The asymmetric corridor discourages banks from lending to the CBN and pushes them to lend to other businesses or invest in intrustments that would be profitable for them. 
Better days ahead?
We wish we could see the future, but our time machine is still in R&D. However, it’s not difficult to see how these changes by the CBN, are intended to move Nigeria off the inflationary pathway. We hope you found this breakdown helpful. If you’d like to learn more about banking, finance and technology, visit our blog to read more.

What’s the point of PoS receipts?
byEmmanuel Paul
Ever stood in line at your local supermarket, watching as receipt after receipt gets printed out for each customer? Ever wonder where all those slips of paper end up? In many Nigerian stores, they often land in the waste bin close to the security at the entrance. But have you ever stopped to think about why we still get them, and what role they play in our daily lives?
These slips of paper, especially from our everyday transactions at the Point of Sale (PoS) machines, are more important than we might think. They're not just for customers but also for businesses and banks. Even as everything moves online, I've noticed that paper receipts are still the go-to, even though digital options are available (companies like ours offer this choice).
Ezekiel, our head of distribution, shared his insights for this story. Together, we'll explore why PoS receipts are still around, why they matter to everyone involved in a transaction, and peek into what shopping could look like in the future without them. First, how did we get here? 
Historical context on receipts
The journey of the receipt through history is fascinating. From the earliest days of trade, merchants and customers have used receipts for record-keeping, and trust-building. As buying and selling changed, so have receipts. 
Point of Sale (PoS) Terminal receipts
Global Milestones
Sweden: Often leading in digital innovations, Sweden saw a major shift towards digital receipts in the 2010s, with many retailers and banks promoting digital transactions to move towards a cashless society.
Japan: Known for its meticulous record-keeping, Japan introduced electronic receipts in major retail chains in the late 2000s, blending tradition with technology.
Today, digital receipts are offered by businesses globally, from small stores to multinational corporations. However, the transition isn't uniform, with many consumers and businesses still preferring or requiring paper for various reasons.
Why PoS paper receipts are still a thing
Receipts, whether digital or paper, are important to help businesses and customers confirm and reconcile every transaction they make. It’s what you present to the bank if there’s an error or a dispute. Most importantly, it’s required by law. Even though you can get these receipts digitally, there are still practical reasons why paper will still be a thing. 
Practicality for Businesses
Paper receipts help businesses stay efficient and prevent fraud.
Imagine a cashier in the middle of a high-traffic festive shopping season, with several, mostly impatient customers, waiting in the queue. The cashier can quickly verify the printed receipt without inspecting the PoS device closely or checking an email for each transaction. 
If the PoS is configured to print a second receipt only for successful transactions, the attention-stretched cashier can quickly spot a failure if a second receipt doesn’t come out. It reduces the risk of errors or customers trying to play a fast one. It also helps both customers and merchants keep a record of the transaction.
Settlement
Network glitches can sometimes prevent the bank from settling the merchant. When this happens, the merchant can provide physical evidence that the bank’s systems may have missed. This is even more important in Nigeria, where banks can settle merchants instantly. 
For Consumers
The cashier is not the only one stressed in that busy shopping traffic we just pictured. Customers standing in queues waiting to checkout amidst the sensory overload can be draining, and they could miss important details. 
Evidence of failed debit and for invoicing
If a customer has a failed debit, the receipt can help them seek redress at their respective bank. If the transaction is successful, the receipt is still important for record purposes. Especially if said customer is helping someone else with that transaction. 
Accuracy
It happens, sometimes accidentally, that the cashier enters N10,000 instead of N1,000. Instant receipts allow the customer to check that they paid for the right products at the right amount, and that there was no mix-up. 
Reaching everyone
Not everyone can access a smartphone or the Internet, but everyone shops. When merchants give customers a record of their purchase, it’s a simple step towards ensuring everyone is included in the financial system. 
For service providers
PoS device adoption
As you’ve probably guessed from our historical timeline, not all PoS terminals can issue digital receipts, so paper allows some financial institutions to comply with the law. 
Backup for service disruption
If network glitches prevent receipts from sending to the merchant's email, paper can be used as a backup. 
The above benefits capture a typical Nigerian shopping experience, and while digital receipts have their benefits, paper receipts offer practicality for a typical merchant and consumer. It’s instant, easy to use, and dependable. Interestingly, Nigerians are not alone in preferring paper receipts. 
On the global stage 
Different countries have varying levels of preference for receipts. Surveys conducted in 2022 and 2023 might surprise you: 
The United States
About 72% of American consumers prefer paper receipts to digital receipts. They do this because it makes them feel safe and certain. Those younger than 44 tend to lean towards digital, while those between the ages of 16 and 24 don’t even care for receipts at all. 
Europe
Surprisingly, 54% of European consumers prefer paper receipts, and 27% have no preference at all. Most of them cite some of the practical scenarios we listed above as their reason for opting for paper receipts. 
How we approach PoS receipts
We’re all about giving businesses and customers the tools they need to create financial happiness, so we employ an innovative approach to PoS receipts that focuses on benefits to the user. 
Fueling digital adoption with reliability
We built our site reliability services to maintain 99.99% uptime. When we added instant settlement to the mix, confidence, fewer and fewer people (merchants or customers) saw the need for paper receipts, which are most important for disputes. As a result, merchants opt for our smaller terminals that don’t give receipts, which is usually cheaper.  Network glitches happen often, but we make sure this never happens on our systems 99% of the time. In the unlikely event of downtime, we work on rectifying the transactions during the affected period. 
Tapping into culture to digitise people
Digitisation is a gradual process, and we first tap into the existing culture by giving people paper receipts, which they’re comfortable with. Some merchants don’t want paper receipts, others can’t do without them, and we cater to all in a way that suits their operations. 
Accessibility
We allow merchants to download these receipts from their apps. Digital receipts might exist, but some do not allow merchants access to these receipts whenever they want. We provide end-of-day reports summarising daily transactions, making it easier for merchants to verify sales against receipts.
Sustainability
Paper receipts take their toll on the environment, and we’re making steps to cater to the current user habits while providing more sustainable digital options for merchants. This work extends beyond transaction receipts, and it saves costs for the merchants. 
Bringing it together
Globally, paper and digital receipts play a big part in how people interact with money, from cities to remote villages. This blend helps bridge the gap, ensuring no one's left behind as the world moves more online. However, as long as there’s Internet and power infrastructure failure in Nigeria, and payment rail failure, paper receipts will remain a thing. 
Ultimately, it’s all about finding the right balance with innovation, and we're committed to doing that every day. If you'd like to be a part of our journey, there's room for you. Visit our careers page to get started.

What’s mentorship got to do with employee experience?
byGbemi Adekanmbi
An employee is cruising through the career highway and suddenly senses a gap. Maybe it’s a lack of hard skills, or they think it’s time to upgrade the soft skills they already have. Moments like this can be pivotal for your employees, and how your company addresses this could impact overall productivity.
This is where mentorship comes in as a trusty co-pilot in creating the best employee experience for your staff. Mentorship helps people go beyond their current checkpoints, and let’s face it: life is a learning curve. Let’s take a dive into how you can help your employees when they come across this path.
Why you should care about mentorship.
As the Employer Brand Lead at Moniepoint, I’ve seen firsthand how mentorship can turbocharge careers and also the trajectory of an organisation. From employee engagement to improved culture, here are some reasons why mentorship is something we care about;
Employee development
Mentorship initiatives give employees the opportunity to learn and enhance certain skills. They gain valuable insights that enhance their professional capabilities and this can have a positive ripple effect on the organisation.
Knowledge transfer
Mentorship is an excellent way to foster the transfer of knowledge, best practices and organisational culture, from experienced employees to newer or less experienced ones. It helps preserve organisational knowledge and ensures continuity, especially during periods of transition or turnover.
Increased engagement
Engaging in mentorship programs and initiatives fosters a sense of belonging and support among employees. At Moniepoint, we also call this Membership. They feel more valued and supported which leads to higher levels of job satisfaction. This in turn increases their level of motivation and commitment to the organisation. 
Leadership development
A strong organisation is one where all employees have a certain level of leadership skills, and you can build such skills through mentorship. With mentorship, mentors have the opportunity to hone their coaching, communication and leadership capabilities. On the other hand, mentees develop leadership qualities through guidance, feedback, and role modelling. 
Employee retention and loyalty
Incorporating mentorship programs in the organisation strengthens the bond between employees and the company. Through the value they gain, they have a higher commitment to staying long-term with the organisation. This reduces turnover rates and its associated costs. 


Putting the 'M' in Mentorship.
Within an organisation, mentorship can take different forms. At Moniepoint, here are a few ways we explore it on our team;
A dedicated L&D team
Moniepoint has a commitment to nurturing talent and fostering growth through its learning and development department. Our employees can always reach out to the team if they’ve identified a skill gap they desire to fill and get linked with the right resources. This extends to every level of our organisation. 
Open communication system
We also run an open inter-team communication system. This extends beyond our open-door policy, to a system where you can get and receive feedback from anyone, irrespective of level or department. Anyone can collaborate with anyone, getting knowledge and insight to ensure that they can give their best. 
Internal hiring system
For employees looking for a path to grow, we make it possible for them to shadow teams outside of their own. This gives them an opportunity to explore other career paths they might be interested in and allows them to pivot. For anyone on our team, it’s possible to gain new skills, or switch paths with ease.
Women in Tech Initiative
Each year, Moniepoint selects five women for its Women in Tech initiative, placing them in various departments across the company. These women are then assigned mentors within their designated teams, and they get to learn while executing projects. This initiative not only provides invaluable opportunities for career advancement but also provides a path for these teams to grow as well.
Give mentorship a shot. 
If you want to include mentorship, you need to define the goals and objectives of the mentorship program you have in mind. It helps determine what skills or knowledge gaps the program aims to address and how it aligns with the organisation's overall mission and values. 
Then, develop a structured mentorship program with defined roles, responsibilities, and expectations for both mentors and mentees within divisions or departments. In developing this structure, you should also provide guidelines and resources to ensure participants understand their roles and how to maximise the benefits of the programs. 
It’s important to put careful consideration into matching mentors and mentees. It could be based on skills, experiences, and career goals. You can consider factors such as personality compatibility, communication styles, and shared interests to facilitate meaningful mentorship relationships. 
Diversity and inclusion are also integral aspects of any mentorship program. While incorporating mentorship initiatives, encourage participation from people across different departments, backgrounds, and levels of experience to foster a rich exchange of perspectives and ideas. It is also important to foster a culture of open communication and continuous improvement by encouraging regular feedback and evaluation from both mentors and mentees. 
Get it right!
When knowledge flows seamlessly within a team, efficiency skyrockets. Everyone is equipped with the knowledge they need to give their best. Win-win! 
If you’d like to work in an organisation that prioritises your growth just as much as its own, we’ve saved you a spot. We’re waiting for you.

Moniepoint MFB, CAC Partner To Boost SMEs Development, Target 30 Million Businesses in 5 Years
byBemigho Awala
In line with a critical mandate, of the Federal Government to unleash Nigeria's full economic potential by focusing on job creation, access to capital for small and large businesses and inclusiveness, the definitive bank for small and medium-sized businesses in Nigeria, as well as their customers and employees, Moniepoint Microfinance Bank Limited and the Corporate Affairs Commission (CAC) have joined forces to digitize and formalize operations for over 2 million small and medium businesses across Nigeria.  This unprecedented move will foster economic growth, ensure alignment with regulatory compliance whilst providing SMEs with access to capital that will enable them unlock their potentials, contribute significantly to job creation and drive shared prosperity.
In a brief ceremony which was held at the Bank of Industry, BOI office in Abuja, Minister of Industry, Trade and Investment, Dr. Doris Uzoka-Anite, while describing the initiative as monumental, reiterated the Federal Government’s commitment to catalyzing economic development by supporting small and medium businesses with funding, thus creating a conducive environment for them to flourish and generate more opportunities.
Acknowledging Moniepoint’s innovative strides, Dr. Uzoka-Anite pledged greater collaboration towards formalizing additional MSMEs. She noted that the Federal Government was prepared to deepen its engagement with the company, adding that it would consider its request for provision of cheaper funding and grants to enable it draw more small businesses into the formal space, as well as create an enabling environment for them to thrive.
'The current administration is excited and passionate about creating jobs, ensuring financial inclusion and poverty alleviation. These things add up towards economic development. A lot of people have ideas but are impeded by lack of access to the right learning environment and education. Which is why we are happy to collaborate and support players like Moniepoint to bring more people into the financial sector and help the government achieve its mandate,', the Minister said.
On his part, Managing Director, Moniepoint MFB, Mr. Babatunde Olofin expressed delight at the partnership and said that the engagement was in furtherance of the organization’s mantra of powering dreams while creating a society where everyone experiences financial happiness.
He said, ''We recognize that these businesses are the lifeblood of economies, so their growth directly supports the entire economy, essentially extending our ability to positively impact everyone else. We are heavily invested in super charging Nigeria’s economic ambitions so that enormous employment opportunities can be created and lift millions of Nigerians out of poverty. This initiative is in strong alignment with the Federal Government's agenda - financial inclusion, job and wealth creation and economic growth. Our target is that in 5 years, we will onboard 30 million businesses in collaboration with the CAC as we leverage technology to create a win-win situation for all stakeholders.' 
Registrar-General/Chief Executive, CAC, Hussaini Ishaq Magaji, SAN lauded the Minister for her visionary strides since assumption of office, noting that the feats recorded by the agency were results of the robust support and guidance she has consistently provided. He stated that the commission’s objective of formalizing 20 million small businesses while describing the 2 million businesses sign-up with Moniepoint MFB as a watershed moment in Nigeria’s economic trajectory which heralds a transformative shift that will lay a sturdy foundation for sustained growth and prosperity in Nigeria.
'Mr. President has promised 50 million jobs for the youths. This ground-breaking ceremony will set the target off. What we are witnessing today has never happened before in Nigeria. The participation of all these stakeholders underscores the profound significance of this occasion, symbolizing a unified resolve to propel Nigeria’s economic landscape towards unprecedented heights of progress and promise,' said the CAC boss.
The registration of businesses and organizations across the nation has been a core mandate of the CAC over the years. This mandate which confers legal identities on businesses has been instrumental to connecting enterprises to essential opportunities that have facilitated access to financial facilities, and enabled them to increase their revenue streams.

Making a career at Moniepoint out of my passion for fixing problems.
byJoy Ayeke
Solving problems barely sounds like the most fun thing to do. But little else is as exciting for someone like me, who grew up fixing things. From starting out in electrical engineering to exploring a career in tech, here’s how I found myself at Moniepoint - solving problems for people using our products to power their dreams.
A little about how I got here
If you’re one of those people who read other career stories and think, 'Well, good for you that you already knew what you wanted to become from a child; I figured mine along the way…', then welcome. You and me both. Although I would not consider myself someone who is totally clueless, I didn’t think I would be in tech. I mean, how many homes knew 'tech' to be what it is today at the time? 
As a child, I always wanted to fix things. I grew up in a family of 5 girls. And believe me when I say my dad had no intention of leaving any stone unturned (or any wire uncovered in this case). He taught us all the 'handy jobs' that were referred to as boys' jobs. As a teenager, I could change tyres, fix electricals in the house, service generators, name it (lol).
By the time I was applying to a university, I already knew that I wanted to have a career that had to do with fixing problems, so I went for mechanical engineering. 
Engineering school, and a career detour.
As excited as I was to study mechanical engineering, I began to have a change of heart as I went along with it. By the time I graduated from Ambrose Ali University in 2016, I already knew I wouldn’t be an electrical engineer professionally.
But what then? I still had my urge to solve problems. I just wanted to do it in a different way. As someone who liked to read a lot, I could already see that tech was the 'now' of Nigeria. And it was the surest way problems were being solved. I started taking online courses, watching YouTube videos, and attending conferences. I consumed everything I could about tech and started applying for jobs.
Five months after graduating, I got my first job in tech. I worked with Fintrak Software Limited as a three-year graduate trainee, shuffling departments until I found the one that aligned the most with my problem-solving skills - Application Support.
Today, I work with Moniepoint as a technical support engineer. 
What it’s like working as a technical support engineer.
So, yes, I’m fixing problems for the customer. But what does this look like? And how do I make this happen in collaboration with other teams like customer support and product engineering?
On a daily basis, my responsibilities involve monitoring various services, including onboarding and front office services, to ensure there are no impediments that could hinder customers’ experiences. Additionally, I provide support to customers through the customer support team, addressing issues ranging from onboarding difficulties for business owners to KYC upgrade issues. Ultimately, I aim to ensure customer satisfaction and smooth utilisation of our services.
Every time I fix an issue for a customer, I still get that joy I got as a kid from checking what was wrong with a fan and telling my dad the problem so it could be fixed - only on a higher level. 
Collaborating with other teams
The customer support personnel is typically the first point of contact with a customer who has an issue. The goal is first to find out what the customer needs and manage their expectations as we work to resolve the issues they may be having.  Some of these issues can easily be resolved by guiding the customer to take the right steps; some are technical corrections that need to be made. This is where we usually come in.
The customer support personnel escalates the issue to me, the technical support engineer, to fix it. I examine the customer records and technical logs to diagnose and resolve the problem. I take my time to breakdown the problems and solve them step by step. Once I’ve resolved it, I  inform the customer support personnel, who relate to the customer.
Why Moniepoint?
Three years ago, I didn’t know or hear much about Moniepoint. But now, I don’t even have to explain for people to recognise where I work. The impact we have had in helping businesses is very visible, and when I was applying, I just knew I wanted to be a part of it.
I have a personal story of a friend whose parents were struggling with bank issues for their business. They would have cases where alerts were not dropping on time, or they could not reconcile daily transactions seamlessly. When they opened a business banking account with us, that story changed. She calls me randomly to sing our praises, and I feel proud to be here.
And it’s not just about our impact externally. Before joining, I had heard stories of staff highlighting the culture, and I was curious (I mean, people lie about these things). But I’m here now, and I can attest to the fact that everyone is respectful of each other. The fact that I know my ideas are heard and implemented is also something I feel good about, and I’m excited to be a part of this team.
If you love solving problems like I do, then you should absolutely join us. Visit to find your path to us.https://moniepoint.com/careers

On being a creative director in a financial institution, with Yemi Arawore
byGbemi Adekanmbi
For Yemi, navigating the sometimes turbulent waters of communication challenges and finding creative answers is an apt description of his daily routine. Sitting through an interview with him to talk about his work process felt like an education in how ​​non-linear roadmaps can bring meaning - that there’s always a rhythm and rhyme even in a world of ever changing, ever increasing variables.
In this conversation, we explored what it means to be a creative director at a financial institution, and everything in between. Come on the journey with me.
What does the creative direction process look like, from the moment a brief gets on your table?
A major thing for me when receiving a brief for the creative team is clarity. Having a good understanding of the end goal and the big-picture objective of the brief. We've got to have as much understanding of what is being sold as the product owner does. You can’t sell what you don’t know. Once we interrogate the brief and have that understanding, we then proceed to work on it.
Once the creative team has attended to the brief, they share what they've done with the creative strategist; he's the first gatekeeper who takes a look at what has been done, speaks to them about it, and ensures that it's as close to perfection as possible, and then I come in.
At this point, my role would require me to do some quality assurance, ascertaining the quality of the idea generated -  whether it's from a copy perspective, a visual perspective or a holistically conceptual perspective. I take a look at it and decide if the idea(s) actually tick the boxes required in the brief.
If not, I have another discussion with the creative strategist or the creative team where we interrogate the idea(s) and strip them completely bare, looking for that tiny gem of brilliant simplicity that can actually turn that idea around. 
My objective at this point would be to assist the creative team with what I call concept generation triggers, especially if I notice there’s some creative fatigue or mental blocks, I’d suggest my own thoughts to help the team rediscover their creative elixirs. Once I can open up their minds to see other possibilities and inspire them, then they're able to break out of their mental blocks and come up with great stuff. 
How do you think through tasks, and manage expectations in a sometimes unpredictable workspace?
We work in a very fast business environment. Aside from the usual administrative and creative management responsibilities, certain things pop up without warning and this could be due to a number of factors: market trends, sentiments, economic policies, industry regulations, and a host of other things. We are also very data-centric at Moniepoint, so whatever the data tells us is what informs our next line of action.
However, I work very closely with the director of product marketing, Chinedu, and from that relationship, I'm able to understand where the brand is, what the brand needs from a communication perspective, what objectives need to be met, as well as determining what kind of communication the brand requires to meet its objectives at any given point in time.
Not everything can be solved by TV, radio, or still visuals. This means there are times you may have to proffer solutions that are outside of the regular spectrum. In other words, 'How else can we push certain products, or features to our target audience out there?' including the 'Who?', 'What?', 'When?', 'Where?' and 'How?' questions. Sometimes the most effective channel to use may not be the obvious one, and you just have to determine which one will deliver the best results at what time.
That's where I come in as a creative director - to guide the creativity of my team; guide their thought processes, and the ideation creation processes, and also proffer solutions, wherever there are creative roadblocks.


As Creative Director, are there times that you get into a rut? That place where you are tunnel-visioned and really cannot ideate about a particular product or a thing? How do you come out of that?
I go through that pretty much all the time. Having a creative roadblock is not a sign that you’re losing your creative touch. It's just a sign that you are trying not to do the obvious but you just haven't figured out the way to break through the usual, into the unusual.
Here's a secret - for every brief that I'm given, I'm usually blank at first.
At the beginning of my career, it scared me. However, I came to realise that what I called a creative block or blankness, was my brain trying to reconfigure itself to absorb the new information that's presented in the new brief.
First, I reach out to my team members. There's a lot of value in constructive teamwork, so when I hit a roadblock, I'm not too proud to go to my team members and say 'Hey, I'm working on so-and-so, and I don't seem to be making any headway. Maybe I've gotten too close to the brief and I need a fresh pair of eyes to take a look at it and then just tell me what you think.'
Whatever they say when they take a look at the brief may not directly be what I'm looking for, but there just might be something in between the lines (or even nuanced) that’ll lead to the light-bulb moment.
The second thing I do is to take a break. The best figurative expression for it is - when you sit too close to the TV, you can't see the entire TV… you can't see the entire screen, and you can only watch one character at a time.
That's how I see it mentally. A mental block may be a sign that I'm too close to the screen. I’ve probably been looking at the brief from just one particular angle and I've become tunnel-visioned. I need to step back and develop a much broader understanding.
What does stepping back and taking a break look like?
One of the ways I step back from the brief is to jump on another brief. It doesn't mean that the other one would stop (because mentally, I’ve not completed it yet).
Or I do something different - watch something, play a video game, or play with my dogs. I call it constructive distraction. Your brain probably has been overheating and you need to calm down by doing something else that relaxes it, and as it starts to relax, your subconscious ruminates on the brief at hand.
And how I know that I've actually hit a gold mine is that I actually feel a thump in my chest. Like shoot, this is it. This is the Eureka moment. And, that's pretty much how I handle creative blocks.
I’ve always been fascinated by creative backgrounds and how they shape a Creative Director. What's the difference between having a copywriting background and having a design background for a creative director role?
Naturally, our core abilities will play a role in how we analyse work. A creative director with a copywriting background will probably have a copy-first approach ie. look at the copy first and try and see that the copy actually says what it's meant to say.  And the same goes for the more graphic-design-oriented creative director; they would probably have a design-first approach. However, personally, I disagree with either route and I try to consistently wean myself off the 'stereotype'. 
Here’s my reason; Over the course of time globally, the lines between copywriting and art direction have been blurred; meaning that you don't actually have to be a copywriter to put your idea into words, nor do you have to be a graphic designer to direct art.
A copywriter no longer behaves the way a traditional copywriter will behave, because now they no longer see the creative challenge from just a copy perspective. They see the creative challenge from a more holistic concept-led perspective. And the designer shouldn't see a creative challenge from just a visual expression perspective. Rather, they should see it from a conceptual point of view. 
The developed concept is then cascaded across communication channels; digital banners, print ads, TV commercials, radio commercials, or whatever IMC combination you choose. It's all driven by concept. 
When it therefore comes to being able to direct creativity, I would rather that a creative director has elevated himself or herself above the constructs of copy and graphics into the realm of concepts. Because as a creative director, you cannot say that you don't know how to direct art because you have a copywriting background, or that you don't know how to direct copy because you have a design background.
The role of a Creative Director is not usual at a financial institution or bank. Did you ever think you’d work with a financial institution?
Hahaha. Nope! I grew in my creative career, seeing financial institutions as conservative and thinking they would stifle freedom of expression. Working at Moniepoint has changed that narrative for me because Moniepoint values creativity and technical depth - 'What do you bring to the table? How well do you do what you do?'
I know a couple of organisations are adopting the strategy where they have an entire creative unit in-house, but it's not common just yet, especially in our industry. And for that reason, I would applaud Tosin, our CEO, for having the vision of domiciling a properly structured creative unit in-house.
And we can see the impact of that in our communication across the board. If there's one thing people look out for now, it is 'What's Moniepoint going to come up with next?'. People have so far enjoyed the creative output from the brand. And it's really not just because there's a creative director, but because there is a properly structured creative unit. 
You talked about your dogs as being part of your constructive distraction. Would you call them a creative muse?
Creative muse? No, they are not, they are way too lazy and eat too much of my food to be muses. 😅😅
Whenever I feel overwhelmed, I try to distract myself; and sometimes I do so by playing with my dogs. Other times, I don't have to play with them, I just have to watch them and then I relax immediately because they always get up to mischief, and do something ridiculous that would make me laugh. That helps me relax. And in my relaxed state, I'm more productive.
I guess that's the function they play in my professional life.
What’s your favourite Moniepoint campaign?
As the Creative Director, I cannot choose. 😂 I love all the campaigns, honestly! But if there's one that I absolutely cherish, and I wouldn't call a campaign, it's the brand tagline, 'Powering Dreams'. 
My team and I developed that on my second day of resumption, and looking back at the work and discussions that went into it, it makes me extremely happy, every time I see how it has evolved from being a tagline to becoming the ethos of the brand.

And there you have it! I learnt quite a lot from this conversation with Yemi, and I’m sure you did, too. If you’d like to do cool things with a creative and effective marketing team, we're waiting for you. Join us.

How to Check Your Bank Verification Number (BVN)
byChidinma Nwonye
Alright, picture this – you have to fill out that government form, open or upgrade your business account or personal bank account, or fill out a financial-related form. 
Here’s the challenge; you need to input your BVN and you might not remember the first digit let alone all 11 digits. 
I understand this and can help you out.
Let’s explore what a BVN is, how to check bvn, and why you may need to check it. 
Don't have a Moniepoint Bank Account? Click here to download it today.
What is a Bank Verification Number (BVN)?
(Source)
On the 14th of February, 2014, the Central Bank of Nigeria, in collaboration with the Nigeria Inter-Bank Settlement System (NIBSS), introduced the concept of the BVN. It is an 11-digit number used to identify all customers of financial institutions in Nigeria. 
This means that your BVN is the number attached to your financial accounts that your bank can use to identify you as a customer. Like your National Identification Number (NIN), your BVN is linked to your biometric information, including date of birth, full name, and contact details. 
These details are captured when registering your BVN at any bank or verified registration center. The aim of creating the BVN is to improve financial security through banking in the country by preventing financial crimes and fraud nationwide. 
How to Check for your BVN Number
If you need to retrieve your BVN to access an essential financial process quickly, here are some simple steps.
1. Dial the USSD code to check your BVN
You can check your BVN by simply dialing the code *565*0# using the phone number you used to register your BVN. By following the prompts displayed after you dial the code, your BVN will be displayed on your mobile device for a service fee of N20. The method is fast and doesn’t require any internet connection. 
(Source)
2. The Nigeria Inter-Bank Settlement System (NIBSS) Website
(Source)
With a vision to be the leading provider of innovative financial services in Nigeria, the NIBSS website provides a BVN lookup tool to enable you to verify and retrieve your information. You can check your BVN through the NIBSS website by following these steps;
Visit the NIBSS website on your mobile device or computer
Input your name and date of birth
Type in the phone number linked to your BVN
Click on 'Submit.'
Choose your desired payment option and pay the required verification fee of N20.
Once your payment is successful, you will see the verified BVN displayed on your screen. Do well to take a screenshot or write it down in a safe place.
3. Contacting the BVN Helpdesk
Another simple way of retrieving your BVN is by contacting the BVN helpdesk through their toll-free number – 0700-2255-226 or email – bvn@nibss-plc.com.ng. Ensure you provide the correct details, such as your full name, date of birth, email address, and phone number linked to your BVN. 
Once they verify your details, you’ll receive your BVN details from the comfort of your current location.
4. Go to a National Identity Management Commission Office (NIMC)
If you have registered for your National Identification Number and have your ID details, you can visit any NIMC office. By providing them with your correct information, they can assist you in retrieving your BVN quickly.
How to Check your BVN on MTN, GLO, Airtel and 9Mobile
Whether you’re using MTN, GLO, Airtel, or 9Mobile, you can check your BVN using the following steps:
Dial the code *565*0# on the phone number you used to register for your BVN
Confirm that you agree to the prompted N20 fee
Input your transaction pin
Your BVN is displayed on your screen.
With the same code number, you can check your BVN across the network service providers in Nigeria. The best part is that you don’t need to be connected to the internet. With just N20 naira, your digits get displayed.
Why do you Need a Bank Verification Number?
As a Nigerian citizen, your BVN is your secret identity to access innovative banking financial services. Here are some reasons you will have to check it;
To Verify your Identity: Banks like Moniepoint Microfinance Bank require you to verify your identity when opening new accounts, upgrading your KYC levels, or performing transactions. By providing a valid BVN, you are cleared to perform your desired financial operations.
For Security Purposes and Fraud Prevention: Your BVN is your unique banking identification number, which the CBN put in place to ensure that your account is not susceptible to fraudsters. If you notice suspicious activities on your bank accounts, contact your customer representative to cross-check using your BVN.
Changes in Personal Information: If you undergo a vital change in your details, such as your name, biometric data, and contact information, you will need your BVN to complete the required forms.
Linking Different Accounts: In cases where you have different bank accounts and wish to link them, you must provide your BVN to do so successfully.
Loan Application: When you apply for a loan or credit service, the lender may require your BVN to verify your identity and facilitate the process.
Payment and Beneficiary Verification: In most cases, NGOs or governments may require your BVN to process payments or verify beneficiaries. It can occur in grant applications, social welfare programmes, etc, and your BVN is a qualifying factor to access such payments.
Account Recovery and Emergencies: If you need to recover your blocked or lost account, you’ll need to verify your identity by providing specific details, including your BVN.
Final Words
Ultimately, your BVN allows you to access unlimited financial operations in the Nigerian banking sector. 
Thankfully, in case you forget it, you can always check it through the USSD code, NIBSS website and other helpful means listed in this article. 
Finally, keep your BVN details secure and never share them on public and unverified platforms so that you don’t get duped or scammed.

Moniepoint, Data Protection Commission urge young people to use personal data responsibly
byBemigho Awala
With about 65% of Nigeria's population under 30 years old, the need to raise awareness of data protection rights and responsibilities especially among young people has been brought to the fore. The focus on this huge youth demographic follows from its ability to serve as a great incentive to boost Nigeria’s productivity credentials and the role that they can play in championing an ethical and healthy ecosystem in view of the country’s digital economy aspirations. 
In a bid to raise awareness and ramp up sensitization for data privacy and protection as part of activities marking the National Privacy Week 2024, the definitive bank for small and medium-sized businesses in Nigeria, as well as their customers and employees, Moniepoint Microfinance Bank and the Nigeria Data Protection Commission (NDPC) teamed up to promote responsible use of personal data among young Nigerians.  
'Our youth are the future of Nigeria's digital economy. It is crucial that they understand the importance of data privacy and use personal data responsibly and ethically as they engage with technology,' said National Commissioner/CEO, Nigeria Data Protection Commission, Dr Vincent Olatunji.
He also highlighted the evolution of Data Protection in Nigeria, from the establishment of the Nigeria Data Protection Bureau to its transition into a Commission. He underscored the importance of awareness, which is paramount in building a globally competitive pool of Data Protection professionals to discharge requisite duties under the Nigeria Data Protection Act, NDPA, providing a legal framework for collecting, storing, and sharing personal data. 
According to the Managing Director, Moniepoint MfB, Babatunde Olofin, 'Data is not just a commodity. It is a reflection of our identity.  We recognize that young people are a huge dividend to be harnessed for Nigeria’s socio-economic transformation in terms of innovation, enterprise, and job and wealth creation. Getting young people to become more aware about issues in data protection and privacy is key to succeeding in a digital and globalized environment.'
Furthermore, he stated that, 'we want to empower young people to take charge of their digital lives which starts with knowing your rights and recognizing the value of personal data. As a compliant and responsible data processor, we believe that financial happiness can only happen in an environment where data subjects behave well as responsible digital citizens and we’ll support industry stakeholders to build an ecosystem that encourages all Nigerians to take data protection and privacy seriously.'  
Moniepoint Microfinance Bank continues to heavily invest in Nigeria’s digital economy, an industry that will create enormous employment opportunities for the country’s teeming population and lift millions of Nigerians out of poverty in furtherance of its visionary resolve to create a society where the dreams of Nigerians are powered.
The National Privacy Week 2024 serves as a reminder of the fundamental right to privacy and the importance of protecting personal data from unauthorized access, misuse, and exploitation.

#BackToTheDream: Tobi’s Journey from Moniepoint to Microsoft and Back
byCelestina Dike
People say that the best strategy for achieving a dream is staying on the right path to that dream. But what happens when you do just that, get to the dream and realise it wasn’t what you thought it’d be? 
In this episode of #BackToTheDream, Tobi walks the perfect path to a Big Tech dream, and after a year working at Microsoft, he realises he doesn’t really want to be there. Where does he go next? Well, you guessed right. Back to Moniepoint. 
Curiosity may have killed the cat, but it certainly won’t kill you and me. Let’s have a chat with Tobi and get into his headspace.
Hey Tobi. How are you doing today?
I’m fine. Putting in the work as usual and making sure my engineers give their best.
Alright. Talking about putting in the work. What do you do, and how long have you been doing this?
I’m an Enterprise Architect. Think of an architect but for a digital structure. I listen to what the product team wants, take that dream, and create a structure for my software engineers to build with. The goal every time is to ensure the results from my engineers are functionally accurate and scale properly. I’ve been an Enterprise architect for about a year now, and that’s when I rejoined Moniepoint. 
That’s interesting. You had been here before, then you left and returned. Let’s start from the beginning. How did you get into Moniepoint?
I knew a couple of people who joined Moniepoint, and we used to keep in touch. Sometime in 2019, I did a personal review of my career growth and I wasn’t satisfied. I had risen to a senior software engineer role at the company I was and was meant to be leading a team, but it didn’t make much difference. We weren't creating code. I spent more time doing pre-sales and trying to convince customers to give us gigs. I mean, I was a software engineer, but there was nothing to engineer, and I just knew that it was time to leave.
Around that time, I got wind of an opening in Moniepoint (then TeamApt), and I decided to dig a bit. I called someone I knew on the engineering team to give me a bit of context. After the call, I knew what I had to do. Moniepoint was a relatively small company at the time, with engineers who were ‘engineering’. I could picture myself learning from other engineers and growing. Simply put, I knew what I wanted -  to work on actual products and grow them to scale, and I knew I could find it in Moniepoint. So, I applied for the Software Engineering role and joined in 2020.
A go-getter, I see. So, did we meet your expectations? And why did you leave?
It’s great that those questions came together because the reason I left, is directly tied to why I came back. I joined the team as a software engineer and worked with the cards team. I handled transaction processing - things around debiting cards, checking balances, creating cards, etc. It was thrilling. I’d say everything happened fast, even if I was here for about two years before leaving. I moved from a place where I wasn’t doing anything to a place where I was doing more than everything I wanted to do, if you get me. Moniepoint was so fast-paced that sometimes I couldn’t keep track of my growth or progress. I just found myself moving from one task to another and it was exciting. It felt great.
But after a while, I think about two years, I started feeling like I needed to slow it down a bit. I could see my growth not just in terms of my technical skills, but also in terms of the other core values I had built. I took some time to do a personal review and realised I had built for myself in two years, what would usually take 5 to build, and I was impressed. Beyond being impressed, I wanted more. I wanted to work for one of the big tech companies - the FAAMNNG. Honestly, I didn’t think there were many tech companies that deserved the level of capacity I had built. It had to be a big tech. I wanted to build for the world. I started applying to Amazon, Microsoft, all of them. Interestingly, I got an offer from both companies and went with the latter.  
What was it like in your new dream company?
It was good, and to an extent, I enjoyed working there. But after a while, I just knew I wanted more. Even though the growth opportunities existed, they weren’t as easy to come by. It took a lot of intentionality to explore things that were outside of your primary role. So what you realise is that you have more access to resources that could help you grow but because of the way work was, you’d only grow in exactly what you came to do.
Let me give a clear example: you’re learning the alphabet, and you’d get all the resources you need for that. But then, you would never get the need to learn numbers as there’d never be an opportunity to apply a knowledge of numbers, because it simply isn’t your work. However, I was building for the world and that in itself gave me joy. 
What was it like building for the world?
In itself, it is a good feeling. You see the number of daily users and subscribers and are over the moon. We’re doing this? The feeling is actually good but it didn’t always feel so close to home. I knew I was doing great work, and I enjoyed it, but the fulfilment wasn't the same as when I worked at Moniepoint.
At the time I was leaving Moniepoint, we had started working on launching cards for a wider population than just staff. And even when it was just the staff that used the card, it felt great seeing a colleague use what you work on and receiving direct feedback, so close to home. There, I could see the number of subscribers and be so thrilled, but I always felt distant.
For example, I don’t think my grandma had any or many reasons to do a PowerPoint presentation for example. But every day on Workplace (our intranet), you could see someone talking about how Moniepoint has made transactions more seamless for their parents, partners., neighbours, etc. And, of course, I have my personal experiences, too. 
Why did you return? 
I missed many things - the drive, the autonomy, the culture and the people. 
As I stayed longer at my ‘dream company’ (Big Tech), I realised that maybe the dream I wanted wasn’t the dream I needed. I enjoyed working there, but I wanted more. It felt a bit early in my career to be that relaxed. I started nursing the idea to leave and around that time, Felix reached out to me. I hope I didn’t give him a hard time, but from the first call, I knew I was coming back. Here I am today.
What’s it been like since you returned?
Balanced is the perfect word. I returned to a team with more engineers, including some of the people I worked with before. The team still had some of the best engineers I had worked with; we had grown more and delegated more, but the place for active work was still alive.
As I mentioned earlier, I returned as an Enterprise Architect. We were now a business bank working hard to launch our personal banking product, and I joined the cards team again. The excitement that was happening when I joined back gave me no minute to miss where I had just left.
Now, we’ve launched personal banking, and as the number of users keeps increasing, our card requests go higher. When I see feedback that someone got their card in less than 48 hours, they were able to activate it, and they’ve been having seamless transactions, I feel great. I look back, and I’m pretty glad I took that call from Felix. But the work I do is not the only thing I'm proud of. I've seen growth in the structure and culture. I mean, I was here when we were way smaller and gave less attention to some things. To see a quarterly performance review structure that’s functional is impressive. 
What would you say to someone looking to join or rejoin Moniepoint?
The culture is excellent, and I have enjoyed working with my teammates. Even if the team has grown and it’s not the same people, one thing is constant: the engineers are great (sorry to other departments, lol). The company is also fast-paced, so be ready to roll your sleeves and do the job. 
If you’re rejoining, I can tell you that we’ve grown, and the structure keeps improving. I think there are some advantages to returning. You already have an idea of the work process and culture; your worth is not up for debate. If it’s your first time, you’re welcome. The one thing I can assure you of is a growth in the scale of our impact. The difference between my first time here and now is glaring regarding how well people know and see us, so you’re welcome to grow with us. 
At Moniepoint, we believe employees should have opportunities to grow, find meaning in what they do, and make decisions they’d never have to regret. There’s always a space for you, whether it’s your first or second time joining us. We can’t wait to hear about your journey and welcome you back when you’re ready.

What's the point of card payments?
byEmmanuel Paul
Imagine this: You just walked into your favourite restaurant to grab lunch. You skipped breakfast, so you’re already salivating over the native rice you just ordered. It’s your turn to pay, and the cashier asks you a question you’ve heard a million times before: 'Cash, card or transfer?'. 
If you’re like most Nigerians, the data suggests you’ll most likely whip out a card 8 out of 10 times. But the process might not always be smooth.  
Not all cards process smoothly
You just tried to pay, only to see 'issuer or switch inoperative'? That's tech speak for 'Oops, we can't reach your bank right now.' Let's not start with the trouble you went through to get that card or what it will take to file a complaint if there’s a problem.  
Also, business owners experience issues when transactions fail, and the customer is debited. There are also problems with fraud. No one wants to have headaches in their financial experience.
To resolve some of these roadblocks, we launched a card service that works and lifts the burden for millions. 
I spoke to Damilola, the Technical Product Manager behind our card product, to find out why people love cards and how we smoothen the card payment process. He shared valuable nuggets. Let’s dive in with the first step. 
How do card payments work?
So you’re at the restaurant and decide to pay with your card. The entire process is quite complex, but let’s try to oversimplify what goes on behind the scenes.
The first player is the bank that gave you your card - the Issuer. The restaurant you’re eating at is the Merchant, and their bank is the Acquirer. Between the issuer and Acquirer is the payment gateway that captures the card details and sends them to a card processor. The processor then forwards the transaction details to the card network and issuing bank.
All this happens in seconds, and when you enter the right pin, the funds are earmarked for transfer. In most countries, the actual movement of funds to the merchant could take days, but Nigeria’s payment ecosystem has evolved to facilitate instant settlement of merchants. So the merchant gets credited for the native jollof, minus any charges from their acquiring bank or payment processor. Then you’re on your merry way.
The Cardolypse: Why cards are taking over. 
In 2023, a regulatory change by the Central Bank reshaped Nigeria’s payment space. Before then, people used cards mainly to withdraw cash to spend in shops. The events that followed turned lots of us into regular card users. Because even the regular tomato seller down the street now has a PoS terminal. Transactions at PoS shot up by 40.9% during this period! But it wasn't just about the cash scarcity. There’s more. 
In 2022 alone, Nigerians tapped, swiped, and entered PINs in a flurry of transactions—1.5 billion at ATMs and a staggering 3.9 billion at PoS terminals, cumulatively moving the economy with ₦73 trillion. So, there has to be some unspoken reason for this consistent increase in card usage. 
Banks within reach
The rise of mobile money in countries like Kenya and Ghana made banking accessible to millions of people. While services like Mpesa took over Kenya, agency banking became commonplace in Nigeria in the past few years. The former was mobile-driven, and the latter was card-driven. The ease and simplicity have contributed to the rise of card payments. You can read more about agency banking in this article. 
Millions of people are not tech-savvy
To do a bank transfer with an app or through USSD, you need either an Internet-enabled smartphone or the ability to read and write. However, smartphones are still expensive for most Nigerians, and literacy levels vary.
There’s a lot of friction involved with using banking apps
There’s even an added layer for literate people with smartphones. They’re extra careful with banking apps that are typically hard to use and don’t want to make any mistakes. Cards are straightforward. Insert, enter PIN, and done. 
Old habits look for the next best thing
People love cash because it’s fast; cards are nearly as fast, especially when cash is not within reach. There’s no waiting to confirm if the merchant has received the money. Of course, it’s a different story if you use Moniepoint’s pay-via-transfer feature, but that’s not the point of this story. Cards mimic the speed of cash, while offering the convenience and security of not carrying physical money. 
It’s a global trend.
Nigerians are not the only ones who love paying via cards. UK shoppers use credit or debit cards more than any other payment method. Cards account for 57% of shopping transactions in the UK. 
There are similar stories in the US and Brazil, as you’ll find someone using a debit or credit card for every two transactions. This number is 4 out of 10 in South Africa, another market where people love to pay by card. 
What we're doing differently.
With these few points of mine, I've shown you why cards are a big deal in Nigeria. Here’s how we’re making the card experience for millions of people despite all the bumps I mentioned above. 
Simplifying card deliveries
Imagine getting a new card faster than it takes to say, 'Where's my card?' We promised customers a card in 48 hours and built a system to make that happen. Remember, when people face friction, it’s a massive barrier to financial inclusion, but simplifying the process brings more people to the financial sector. 
Fraud-proof systems
When there’s a fraud issue, it’s a headache for good-hearted people and businesses alike. 
We give customers complete control over their card details, starting from the card itself. We reduce the chances of identity theft by removing any details from the card.
The fear of being defrauded can make people lose trust in the financial system, and we work hard to make that yesterday’s story. 
Easy card control
From the app, users can prevent the card from being used at any channel they don’t want. Be it online transactions, PoS or ATMs. They also get to block the card at any time.
Here again, we stripped down the clumsy processes and moved card ownership from a burden to a tool for financial happiness. 
There you have it—we’ve shown how and why a simple piece of plastic is reshaping our financial landscape, making life a tad easier, one insertion at a time. So next time you're at the checkout and hear 'Cash or card?' you'll know there's a story behind that simple choice. 
If this story excites you, you could help us make the magic happen. We're not just building a future where card payments are easier; we're crafting a world where everyone finds financial happiness. So, if you've got a knack for innovation and a heart for inclusion, click here to join the ranks.

How To Recharge Your Prepaid Meter (2024)
byChidinma Nwonye
Alright. Now you have a prepaid meter — finally, a relief from 'estimated bills' that were squeezing your neck. You’re in full control because having a prepaid meter means you can now control the amount of electricity you use daily. 
Now you might be wondering how to recharge a prepaid meter. Don’t worry! You’re in the right place, and I’ll show you the best ways to recharge your prepaid meter. I’ll also show you how to get the meter, install it, and recharge it so you enjoy its full benefit. 
If there’s one cool thing about using a prepaid meter, it’s that you can monitor your expenses and make the right spending decisions, especially in our current economy. 
How to Load Your Prepaid Meter and Postpaid Electricity Bill
One of the easiest ways to recharge your prepaid and postpaid meters is with Moniepoint. Let’s explore these simple steps below:
1. Go to Google Play Store or Apple App Store and download the mobile app.
2. Once downloaded, open it and create an account if you are a new user. If you already have an account, log in to your personal Moniepoint bank app.
3. Select the 'Pay Bills' icon
4. Click on Utilities. It will take you to a page where you can select your electricity provider.
5. Then enter your Meter Number.
6. Input the amount of electricity you want to buy. The amount will be deducted from your Moniepoint account. If you are using a postpaid meter, you can input the amount stated on your bill.
7. After successful payment, you will receive your electricity token for the prepaid meter. Go ahead and input the token into your prepaid meter.
8. For a postpaid meter, you’ll need to keep the proof to confirm your payment with the electricity official.
Advantages of Paying Your Electricity Bill With Moniepoint
If you think the convenience and high security are mind-blowing, here are more reasons you should use Moniepoint to pay your electricity bill;
Easy to use: By utilizing your mobile device, Moniepoint makes it simple by providing a practical method of recharging your electricity.
Excellent Reliability: You can access Moniepoint services anytime, thanks to our 24-hour availability.
User-Friendly Interface: Moniepoint has a straightforward user interface. Even if you’re not technologically savvy, you can easily use our platform to pay your electricity bills with little assistance. 
Secure Payment: Your safety is as important as your comfort. Moniepoint provides a robust security infrastructure against unauthorised access to our users’ accounts, providing a secure platform. 
Versatile: Bills come with daily breath, right? You can also pay bills besides electricity with Moniepoint, such as cable TV, airtime top-ups, and other services. 
Differences Between Prepaid and Postpaid Meter 
Let’s dive into the differences between prepaid and postpaid electricity meters.
1. Usage Management
Prepaid power is more efficient than postpaid power as it gives you control over the recharge amount. On the other hand, you don’t have as much control when using postpaid electricity. 
2. Payment Methods
Before you can use your prepaid meter, you have to make a payment for an electricity token which you input to access power. Whereas, with a postpaid meter, you make payments at the end of the month through a monthly bill brought to you by your local electricity company.
3. Late Penalties
If you pay your monthly bill after the due date using postpaid electricity, you will receive a late bill payment fee. Alternatively, using the electricity token system, prepaid customers will not receive late fees. However, if the electricity token runs out, they will experience a power cut.
Procedure for Getting a Prepaid Meter and Postpaid Meter
It’s time to take the upper hand on your light bills, right? You can easily apply for either a prepaid or postpaid meter through the following steps below: 
Log on to the electricity distribution company website. 
Click on the 'Download Application Form' menu to download the application.
Fill out the form carefully, providing all of the necessary information
Submit the completed form to your local electricity distribution offices. 
Follow up on your application forms to ensure that your prepaid meter arrives on time.
Final Words
It’s really no big deal, controlling your power expenses just got better. Simply download the Moniepoint mobile apps from the App Store or Google Play Store, or visit the website at www.moniepoint.com to begin.

How can I Reset my Moniepoint Password?
byChidinma Nwonye
'Incorrect Password!' – I know, right? We’ve all been there. You want to access your Moniepoint account to make that quick transaction, pay a bill, or check out your transaction history, but you’re locked out. 
You might be wondering, 'How can I reset my Moniepoint password?' I’ve got you covered! 
In this article, I’ll show you how to reset your password if you forgot it or want to tighten your security. We’ll also see other reasons why you might need to reset your Moniepoint password.
How to Reset Your Moniepoint Password
If you’ve made the decision to reset your Moniepoint password, follow the steps below to do so;
1: Go to your Moniepoint online platform to log in.
2: Click on the ‘Forgot Username or Password' section.
3: A pop-up question will then appear on your screen asking you to choose whether you ‘Forgot Username’ or ‘Password’. Click on ‘Forgot Password’.
4: Enter your Username and click on ‘Next.’
5: Input the OTP sent to your registered phone number.
6: Type in a new password while adhering to the password requirements listed and click ‘Next’. You’ll receive an email verifying if it’s you trying to make the change.
7: After changing your password successfully, you can log in to your account using your new password. You’ll also receive another email updating you on the success.
Why You may Need to Reset Your Moniepoint Password
To ensure the safety of your accounts, here are some reasons you might want to reset your Moniepoint password;
1. You Forgot Your Password 
In our current digital age, the number of online platforms requiring passwords is no joke. This is why your finely combined letter-number password can easily slip your memory. You can use the Moniepoint password reset option if your memory fails you.
2. Changing your Device
You might be required to reset your app password whenever you switch or upgrade to a new device. It ensures your account is safe to use on the new device.
3. Security Concerns
If you notice any unauthorised access or suspicious activity on your bank account, it’s advisable to reset your account. You can avoid potential security breaches by constantly resetting your password to a stronger one. 
At Moniepoint, we provide a tight security infrastructure against unauthorised access to your accounts, ensuring you have a secure platform. 
4. You’re Locked Out of Your Account
While trying so many times to input your password without successfully logging in, you can create a security alert. You will have to take a security measure by resetting your password.
5. Weak Passwords
Creating a strong password is essential, with the number of threatening digital hackers on the loose. You may need to reset your Moniepoint password if you sense it is weak and susceptible to hacking. 
When resetting your password, it is essential to follow the guidelines provided to ensure a solid and impenetrable password.
How to Create a Strong Moniepoint Password
What perfect password combination do you need to create to ensure your maximum account safety? Here are some tips for creating a strong Moniepoint password;
1. Ensure your Password is longer than Eight Characters.
When creating your password, ensure that you make it at least eight characters. This is because using fewer characters makes it easy for hackers to crack it quickly.
 2. Combine Uppercase and Lowercase Letters, Symbols, and Numbers
If you are on the boat of using ‘password’ as your password, the time has come to upgrade. The Moniepoint password requirements include combining uppercase letters, lowercase letters, symbols and numbers. However, these strange combinations can be hard to remember. 
You can avoid this by having an organised platform where you save all your passwords or play around with the first letters and favourite numbers of terms you remember easily.
3. Use Passphrases Instead of Passwords
If you find remembering passwords tiring, I recommend going with passphrases. With passphrases, you can use longer words that make more sense to you. 
You can also separate the words with hyphens, symbols, and numbers; the best part is that they don’t have to be grammatically correct. An example of a passphrase can be 'overripe-pawpaw-falling-forever-letter'. Anything to access your accounts, right? 
4. Use Different Passwords for Your Accounts
It’s tempting to use the same password for all your accounts; no one wants to add the stress of remembering passwords to their daily struggles. However, it can be unsafe for your account as it makes the road smooth for hackers to compromise all your accounts. 
By using unique passwords for your various accounts, be they your Moniepoint personal or business banking accounts, you further secure them.
5. Avoid Using Common Words or Family Members’ Names
When you use common or personal names, you risk being hacked by a close person or even professional hackers. By using tools that speed up the hacking process, they can quickly swarm through words relatable to you and use them against you.
Final Words
While it’s a good practice to use strong passwords and reset them often, rest assured that Moniepoint ensures that your accounts are safe using tight security measures. 
Resetting your Moniepoint password is as straightforward as all our services. Head to our Moniepoint site to explore simple solutions to your business and personal financial needs.

Important Notice: Fraudulent Activities
We are aware that fraudsters constantly develop new tricks to lure individuals and businesses into sharing their personal details. 
SHARE THIS ARTICLE
We have received several complaints concerning some of our customers and merchants falling victims to unknown persons who have in repeated instances defrauded them. We have learnt that these fraudsters call to con our customers by falsely representing our Support Team; and once they obtain their account security information, they gain access to their accounts.
OPay is actively looking into this with the relevant Law Enforcement agencies as investigations are ongoing to ensure that the perpetrators of these acts are dealt with accordingly. Some arrests had already been made. We also want to assure our esteemed customers and merchants that there has been no compromise in our Customer Support Teams. The Support Teams are thoroughly trained and professional in discharging their duties with proper monitoring of all engagements.
We are aware that these fraudsters continue to develop numerous tricks to lure individuals and businesses into sharing confidential information. The approach adopted here by the fraudsters further confirms this assertion. Our technical, operational and anti-fraud teams have been studying closely the approaches conducted by the fraudsters. Based on these, we have made various tailored and upgraded security features and updated infrastructure. OPay users will notice the difference already. We will continue to improve it to ensure that customer data is adequately secured within our system.
Furthermore, as we have been doing through our various channels including WhatsApp, Email, SMS and Social Media Pages for many months now, we are sensitising all our customers on the need to keep their personal data and information confidential. No customers or merchants should ever share their OTPs, passwords or other sensitive information with ANYONE. We will continue to send out tips to enlighten and remind our customers on how to do this.

A Message To Our Aggregators
Our mission remains the same - to financially and socially include everyone without regard for physical borders, boundaries or social status.
SHARE THIS ARTICLE
We understand that we have put out a series of new policies concerning aggregators in the recent short time. We believe that providing more context will enable you to appreciate the policies.
OPay’s focus in the future will be on you – our aggregators. For this, we are creating a platform where hardworking and capable aggregators can reap enormous success from their efforts, more so than anywhere else. We need to do so in ways that allow us to have a business and share our profits and value generously to create a long-term partnership with you.
To do so, we will do two things: Firstly, we will increase the commission that you receive and then give you the ability to develop aggregators under you to build a large-scale business for yourself.
We had announced policies to ‘buy’ new terminals or ‘top-up’ your existing ones: initially increasing the deposits/price for the terminals – this measure enabled us to identify the more committed aggregators. Once the terminal fulfils its lifetime transaction requirement, you will get the FULL deposits back as a refund.
The whole time, you will get a commission that is 3-4 times higher than the next competitor platform in the market. This means that one year with OPay equals 3-4 years with other platforms.
Secondly, we are giving you the privilege to be OPay’s 'Direct Aggregators', where you can, in turn, develop your very own sub-aggregators, who can help you develop agents much faster.
We trust this allows you to create a mini-platform for yourselves and enable you to become a sizable business owner. Typically, you can be more successful as an aggregator by developing a ‘team’ of sub-aggregators than by merely developing your own agents. OPay will give you the whole platform of tools to manage and monitor your sub-aggregators, determine your commissions, and manage your business.
With these tools, if you are a performing aggregator, you will be more successful on the OPay platform, and you will achieve your financial goals faster than anywhere else. Feel free to test us out.
We will continue to explain our policies and tools and answer your questions in the coming days. We will also host a series of local physical meetings and fora with aggregators to listen to your suggestions and feedback. As we innovate boldly, we look to have your feedback and continually improve your suggestions and feedback.
Lastly, please be assured that OPay does not – and never will – deduct your commission in a non-transparent manner. For any questions on your commission, please kindly contact your Aggregator Manager or our Customer Service.
OPay’s mission has always been to financially and socially include everyone without regard for physical borders, boundaries or social status. We will continue to keep this promise in our partnership with you.",blog

Reasons Why People Fall for Financial Scams
Fraudsters play on peoples emotions, from greed to goodwill. Hence, why innocent people fall for these schemes.
SHARE THIS ARTICLE
Intelligent people become victims to these too good to be actual scams. Financial scams cost individuals, organisations and even government agencies billions of Naira every year; these scams do not discriminate against age, gender or geographical location. In one way or the other, most Nigerians have encountered at least one of the fraudulent activities emphasised here.
Renowned author and expert on financial scams, Stephen Greenspan wrote a book called Annals of Gullibility: Why We Get Duped and How to Avoid It. This insightful book came out in December of 2008 but guess what? Ironically, less than a month after (the book launch) he fell victim to the most significant financial fraud scheme in history. When Bernie Madoff’s Ponzi scheme (largest Ponzi scheme in history) finally fell apart. He lost a large chunk of his retirement savings to Madoff.
This is just one in a million stories about how people, regardless of how intelligent they are, fall for financial scams. No one is immune to fraud; unfortunately, there is no vaccine against fraud. Here are the three most common reasons why people like you and I are susceptible to fraud schemes.
The urge to make money without doing anything
Everyone would love the opportunity to earn more money without having to move a muscle. However, making money takes effort and the right intentions. Fraudsters often attract victims with exciting offers that simply do not exist and offer you an opportunity to triple your income by taking action or clicking on an unverified link.
Double their money without knowing the source of revenue
Making money takes work; the commitment may vary however, you should not expect to invest N5,000 naira in an investment scheme and make N30,000 in 24 hours. We hate to break it to you, but this is a SCAM. When an investment scheme seems too good to be true, then you should be more careful because it has a 99.9% chance of being too good to be true.
**(FOMO) The Fear of Missing Out **
Human nature is worried about missing out on the next ‘big thing’ or a scheme that offers exciting returns within a limited time. People are naturally drawn to this type of offer, so fraudsters have taken advantage of this to offer people schemes that are only valid within a particular time frame. Another common tactic fraudsters use is employing others to give testimonials about how their investment platform transformed their lives. In most cases, these people are also culprits. Do not let FOMO blind you into investing your hard-earned money into a fraudulent investment platform.
Fraudsters will always act friendly to gain your trust and confidence before asking you for money. At the end of the day, it is your money, and no one cares about it as much as you do.
Remember to perform your due diligence and verify the platform before making a financial decision.
Here are some ways to make sure you do not fall victim to fraudsters and how to detect fraud.",blog

How to Detect Fraud and the Right Actions to Take
The easiest way to detect Fraud and the actions you should take.

The payment landscape in Africa is rapidly changing with the rise in the number of financial institutions, the number of digital transactions and the popularity of Fintech. At OPay, while we do so much to ensure our users have access to real-time payments, convenient and seamless means of performing transactions. We put in the extra effort to make sure every single transaction is secure and encrypted.
As we keep coming up with innovative ways to build and secure our products, some people are actively looking for new means to defraud unsuspicious people of their hard-earned money. Even social media has amplified these fraudulent activities.
So here is a guide to help you detect the red flags and understand the right actions to take.
So here is a guide to help you detect the red flags and understand the right actions to take.
Money Doubling or Ponzi Schemes: This is a prevalent scenario whereby you receive a phone call or join a social media group that claims you can save with the platform, and your money will be doubled in minutes or days. For example, deposit N20,000 to receive N40,000 in 2 hours. OPay is not a money doubling platform, and we will never encourage any user to partake in any of these investment programs.
Phishing Attacks: Scammers can use emails or text messages to trick you into giving up your personal information. Phishing scams often send links within the messages. Once clicked, you grant access to your personal information or a prompt to fill a form manually with sensitive information such as; your BVN, account number, date of birth, OTP etc.
Advance Fee Schemes: A growing trend from fraudsters involves asking unsuspecting users to pay upfront for a product or service without rendering that service.
Identity Theft: Identity theft occurs when fraudsters have access to your personal and sensitive information. With this information, they can access your account to perform transactions on your behalf.
Debit or Card Fraud: Debit or credit card fraud occurs when your card details are compromised, lost or stolen.
How to Protect Yourself
Do not give out your OTP, password and transaction details to anyone.
Do not respond to calls, emails or messages from fraudsters claiming to be an OPay representative.
Do not invest your hard-earned funds in any Ponzi, investment or pyramid schemes.
Do not pay money to anyone claiming to be an OPay representative with the promise of fast-tracking your POS application.
Stay vigilant at all times; if you suspect your account might have been compromised, send an email to our compliance team at antifraud@opay-inc.com.
We understand that fraud is a major challenge in the financial sector, that’s why we are constantly innovating and creating new ways to protect our customers.

OPay Merchants: How to Spot Fake Naira Notes
A simple guide for OPay Merchants to identify and spot counterfeit naira notes.
SHARE THIS ARTICLE
We have seen an emerging trend in fraudsters creating, distributing and using fake currencies as payment methods. This unlocked level of counterfeiting has cost merchants a lot of money as they bear the entire burden of the loss. Counterfeit currency is a severe threat, and we strongly advise our merchants not to be complacent about it. It is also vital to know that fake notes are not only printed in large denominations (N1,000); they can also be printed in smaller denominations like N50, N100, N200 and N500.
Although counterfeiters’ techniques seem to be improving these days, the notes can be detected. Here’s a simple guide to help you identify genuine naira notes printed and circulated by the Central Bank of Nigeria.
*Here are some ways to spot
Check the Texture
Fake naira notes are typically made from ordinary paper, while genuine notes are made from a special kind of paper. It is essential to check the quality and texture of the notes received before accepting them as payment for a service.
Use Water or Other Liquid
If you are suspicious of a note received, dip it into water or petrol and scrub gently with your thumb. If the money is fake, the colour will wash off easily. Actual notes are water-resistant; hence the colours will not wash off.
Check the Ribbon
Every genuine naira note has a silver ribbon embedded from the top to the bottom of the naira note. With real notes, the thread can be felt; even in old naira notes, this thread is still visible. However, in fake notes, something looks like a thread, but it’s just the paint. Try scratching that ribbon, and it comes off easily.
Use Mercury Bulb
There are other features of the naira note that can’t be seen with naked eyes. These features can only be seen on genuine naira notes and can only be visible with some pieces of equipment. With the use of mercury bulbs, you can spot the difference between fake and real notes.
It is also important to note that the use of counterfeit notes is punishable under the Nigerian constitution. It does not matter if you are aware or not because ignorance is not an excuse in the Nigerian court of law.

Frequently Asked Questions About the OPay Merchant Loans
Here are a few things you should know about the OPay Merchant Loan.
SHARE THIS ARTICLE
What is OPay Merchant Loan?
OPay Merchant loan enables merchants to get access to quick loans of up to N5 million directly on the OPay app. OPay has partnered with Blue Ridge Microfinance Bank to aid the loan process.
What does 'partnered with Blue Ridge Microfinance Bank' for OPay Merchant Loans mean for you?
To help meet our Merchant’s cash flow needs, OPay offers two types of loans through our MFB partner (Blue Ridge Microfinance Bank). The loan agreement will be with Blue Ridge. However, the funds will be deposited into your OPay Merchant wallet, and repayments will be automatically be transferred to Blue Ridge.
In practice, you’ll request your funds in the OPay App and receive your funds and make your repayments from your OPay merchant wallet. OPay will handle all communications with Blue Ridge’s systems to create your loan, send the funds to your wallet and send your repayments to Blue Ridge.
What are the different types of loans available on the OPay Merchant Loans?
There are two types of loans available on the OPay Merchant Loans on OPay;
Short and Long-term loans.
How does a Short-term loan work?
Short-Term Loans will enable you to select a loan amount up to your pre-approved credit limit. The short-term loans are usually due by midnight on the day after the loan was paid into your wallet with a flat fee of 0.3%. As a merchant, you can access up to N1 million daily with the OPay merchant loan.
How does the Long-term loan work?
The long-term merchant loan gives you the option of borrowing funds within a 28–42 days timeframe, enabling you to select a loan amount up to your pre-approved credit limit.
How will I get the Loan when it has been approved?
Once your loan has been approved, you will get the agreed amount in your OPay wallet.
How can I Increase my loan limit?
You can increase your loan limit by actively using the OPay app or POS to perform transactions like; withdrawals, transfers and bill payments.
What are the interest rates and fees associated with OPay Merchant Loans?
The overall interest rates may vary from time to time as economic conditions and default trends change, but we aim to be as transparent as possible with the costs and fees associated with your Merchant Loans. We’ll publish them and be sure to notify you if they are changing in the future.
28–42 Day Loan
The interest fee for 28–42 day loans is dependent on your merchant level, which is defined by the status of your POS sales. Merchant levels will be updated once per calendar month, and once your merchant level changes, you can expect to see the interest fee updated for your next loan.
Also, if you’re unable to pay your loan in full by the due date, you’ll incur a weekly late fee beginning after a 7-day grace period. That also varies per your merchant level. That means that as you grow your OPay POS business, you’ll gain access to lower rates and additional capital!
How can I update my Merchant level?
There are different types of merchants on OPay; Regular, Gold, and Platinum. The Gold and Platinum merchant levels are defined by the OPay POS sales in a given calendar month. Once you pass a threshold in a given calendar month, you’ll be eligible for the lower rate and once merchant levels are updated in the following month. We’ll update the levels on the first business day of the next month.
We also know that businesses will see some fluctuation from month to month, so once you have reached the Gold or Platinum level, you’ll remain at that level until your production has dropped below the POS Sales Threshold for 2 consecutive calendar months. Once you increase your business production again — we’ll move you right back after 1 month above the set threshold.
How do I repay my OPay Merchant Loan?
Once you have received the funds for your OPay Merchant Loan, you’ll repay them any time. When you visit the 'My Account' page for your OPay Merchant Loans account, you’ll see any outstanding loans listed. You can simply click 'Repay' to see the options available for repayment.
Suppose your loan reaches the due date and has not yet been paid in full. In that case, OPay will begin to automatically deduct the remaining balance from your OPay merchant wallet until the amount owing is satisfied in full.
How much can I borrow?
Merchant Loans are only available once you’ve been using the OPay POS to perform transactions for at least 60 days to enable you to learn enough about your mobile money banking business and to determine credit limits.",blog

A Stool in the Lab
Our chief compliance officer, Olaniyi Alao, gives an overview of the key role compliance plays in building a successful product or service.
SHARE THIS ARTICLE
'If you are not at the table, you are likely on the menu.' -Anonymous
Compliance teams are not usually liked. We carry the burden of being the hated guys that love to say, 'No’, and also thrive with the badge of being 'snoopers'. The disdain is not restricted to the Product or the Marketing/Sales team as the 'love-hate' relationship extends to the IT guys too — when it comes to work-related relationship. The IT guys sometimes feel the Compliance guys are unappreciative and all they look forward to is saying, 'No, this cannot work'. A friend once asked if we were wired to say, No, especially when they feel we should be able to do this.
In building a product or providing a service in a regulated environment, it is essential to provide a stool to the Compliance Team in your construction stage. Do not worry, the Compliance Team can only join you on-site — we will wear the helmets (What’s the colour of the day?). At this stage when ideas are being mixed and flying around, you need someone focusing your attention on the guidelines that apply to such product or service. The amendments can come in here, and you would also be advised how we can make the product or service work without incurring the regulators’ wrath.
In the same vein, the IT guys cannot develop a Compliance tool if Compliance had no input. Everyone understands that you developed the idea. However, the Compliance team is the user. In development, stakeholders (especially Compliance) should be part of the board placing process.
The process should begin with Compliance in mind. Put it all on the table — 'we have this idea guys. how do we make it work?' I am not sure there is any Compliance team that is against the entity making profits. You likely have a Compliance team that does not want the profits to be coughed out in fines/sanctions. https://finbold.com/bank-fines-2020/.
With this, the cart is not placed before the horse. The Compliance Team would always provide you with reasons and regulations that do not align with such product or services — since the Compliance team is the team that runs around when the sanctions arrive. I tell people that the approach is usually wrong, hence why the 'Kings of No' would tell you, No!
Both parties need to convince one another and the focus has to be on the organisation.
Do we want to earn a quick buck and lose that to sanctions? Are we ready to put our reputation on the line and respond to a deluge of enquiries from partners?
Due to the adrenaline rush of finding a product that could 'change the game', it is sometimes tempting to forget the potential risks and focus so much on the benefits. It is therefore important to have someone who draws your attention to this during the building process.
Each product or service must have a balance of risks against benefits — take your spots Compliance and Products. Whilst the product team may have tidied the risks inherent in the products, it is usually possible to forget the channels of delivery of the products or the risks of third-party vendors — here comes due diligence. In addition, certain regulatory issues carry increased risk. For example, the new product or service may raise concerns about the fair treatment of or impact on consumers. What about the collection of data or Data Protection issues?
In conclusion, I believe it’s a matter of both parties listening to each other — the ringing question should be, 'how do we do this such that we do not lose?'
Eyes on the profit my friend!

How to Improve your Financial Status
These few tips an help improve your financial status.
SHARE THIS ARTICLE
2021 is moving quickly, in the twinkle of an eye and we are in the second month of the year. 2020 was a challenging, unforgettable and unpredictable year, and folks are still struggling with the cycle of debts or trying to bounce back from the festive period’s financial burden. Moving forward seems like a daunting task, especially during this pandemic period. However, with a little more discipline and making wise financial decisions, you can get back on track.
To shape or plan your financial goals, you have to be realistic, accountable, and disciplined.
Everyone wants to be financially stable, but the most frequently asked question. Remains, how?
Well, don’t be discouraged-you can improve your financial status if you take several small steps.
Draw out a plan
For everything you want to do, you need to develop a plan. Ask yourself, what do you want to achieve? What do you stand to gain if this works out? While planning, remember to give it a timeline or timeframe; this helps you stay committed and disciplined.
Automate Savings
This should be your top priority, especially if you don’t have a solid emergency fund yet. Make it the first bill you pay each payday by having a set amount transferred from your current account to your savings (automate your savings on OWealth or FlexiFixed). Don’t even think about this transaction; make sure it happens every payday.
Control your impulse spending
The biggest problem for many of us is impulse spending. Eating out, shopping and, online purchases is a significant financial drain, the biggest budget breaker for many, and a sure way to be in dire financial straits. With total control and discipline, your impulse spending can be limited and effectively minimized.
Evaluate your expenses, and live frugally
If you’ve never tracked your expenses, try a One Month Challenge. Then evaluate how you are spending your money, and see what you can cut out or reduce. Decide if each expense is necessary, then eliminate the unnecessary.
Personal finance rules will undoubtedly help you take control of your finance and improve your financial status in the long run.
Remember, you can save and earn up to 12% interest return with our savings products OWealth or FlexiFixed.

Traditional Banking Vs. Digital Banking
The Technology revolution has transformed our everyday lives, and the banking industry is not an exception.
SHARE THIS ARTICLE
The Technology revolution has transformed our everyday lives, and the banking industry is not an exception.
Banking itself has been in existence since the 1600s, perhaps even before that, in one form or the other. There has always been a means of performing basic transactions and exchanging money for goods and services from the days of cowries, coins down to the current naira notes we use in exchange for goods and services. Banks were created as a necessity to provide loans and credit as well as reduce exploitation by money lenders to the general public.
There is no doubt that digital disruption is no longer just a change in the ways of life but a shift towards a more convenient way of performing daily transactions.
Although some banks still perform the traditional banking method, it has been necessary to upgrade their mode of operation, hence introducing bank apps and the use of USSD codes for easy payments. Welcome to Digital!
Traditional banking can no longer be maintained if it does not update its services and adapt to the demands of increasingly digitized consumer profiles. Banks have also had to go through the digital transformation process and introduce digital banking elements to their services.
Traditional banking was, no doubt, a lifesaver. Back in the days, we had everything payment-related at the grip of our hands; so far, we visited the banks. At some point, it was the most convenient and reliable form of banking, but take a look at the world today, the world has gone digital over 112 million Nigerians now have access to the internet. Hence, bill payments and transfers are made within a snap of a finger with records to keep track of it all.
There is no doubt that Digital Banking is gaining more and more weight within the financial market, thereby attracting more customers and investors from all over the world.
Traditional Banking and Digital Banking are both titans. Still, with the advancement of technology, everyday Digital Banking is the trojan horse taking over the world. It is happening so fast that most people are beginning to let go of Traditional Banking entirely.
Digital Banking is why we now have a surge in new entrants in the Fintech ecosystem, making and creating a platform where the banked and unbanked can have access to easy and seamless financial services regardless of time and place.

How to Detect Fraud and Identity Theft
Fraudsters continuously devise new methods to rob unsuspicious people of their hard-earned money. Here is how to detect them.
SHARE THIS ARTICLE
Over the past couple of months, we have seen massive spikes in the rate of fraudulent activities. These criminals continuously devise new methods to rob unsuspicious people of their hard-earned money.
At OPay, your financial security is our topmost priority, and we also need to ensure you do not fall prey to fraudsters. We have identified some tactics used by fraudsters and how to safeguard yourself from being a victim.
How to Identify a Fraudulent Activity
Here are common tactics used and how to identify them;
Request for transaction details:
Anyone who requests for your sensitive information such as; OTP (One Time Password), BVN (Bank Verification Number) and PIN (Personal Identification Number are fraudsters. Please do not disclose any of these details to any individual. OPay will never ask you for any of these details to resolve an issue.
OPay Investments:
A claim that OPay is into money doubling investment. (invest N10,000 to get N50,000 within seconds). These claims are untrue, and when anyone claims to double your money or give you large sums of money at an insignificant cost, you should be suspicious because OPay does not offer any money doubling scheme.
Phishing:
Fake or unsecured links are sent to your email and asking you to click on them. Please do not click any of such links without verifying who the sender of such email.
POS Terminal Charge:
Calls or messages, requesting you pay specific amounts of money to a personal bank account to help fast track your POS application must be ignored and reported to ng-antifraud@opay-inc.com.
Unverified Social Media Accounts:
Fake and unverified social media pages are created by fraudsters to rob unsuspicious individuals of their money. Please do not share personal information with unverified accounts and report such pages. All OPay social media handles are verified. It is important to never disclose personal information such as your PIN, BVN and OTP. These fraudsters research every victim and might get some information such as your name correct. However, do not fall prey to fraudsters by giving out any sensitive information.",blog
