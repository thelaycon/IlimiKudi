Important Notice: Fraudulent Activities
We are aware that fraudsters constantly develop new tricks to lure individuals and businesses into sharing their personal details. 
SHARE THIS ARTICLE
We have received several complaints concerning some of our customers and merchants falling victims to unknown persons who have in repeated instances defrauded them. We have learnt that these fraudsters call to con our customers by falsely representing our Support Team; and once they obtain their account security information, they gain access to their accounts.
OPay is actively looking into this with the relevant Law Enforcement agencies as investigations are ongoing to ensure that the perpetrators of these acts are dealt with accordingly. Some arrests had already been made. We also want to assure our esteemed customers and merchants that there has been no compromise in our Customer Support Teams. The Support Teams are thoroughly trained and professional in discharging their duties with proper monitoring of all engagements.
We are aware that these fraudsters continue to develop numerous tricks to lure individuals and businesses into sharing confidential information. The approach adopted here by the fraudsters further confirms this assertion. Our technical, operational and anti-fraud teams have been studying closely the approaches conducted by the fraudsters. Based on these, we have made various tailored and upgraded security features and updated infrastructure. OPay users will notice the difference already. We will continue to improve it to ensure that customer data is adequately secured within our system.
Furthermore, as we have been doing through our various channels including WhatsApp, Email, SMS and Social Media Pages for many months now, we are sensitising all our customers on the need to keep their personal data and information confidential. No customers or merchants should ever share their OTPs, passwords or other sensitive information with ANYONE. We will continue to send out tips to enlighten and remind our customers on how to do this.
We empathise with our customers that may have become victims of these criminals and assure them that we will continue to work with all relevant stakeholders including regulators, business partners and security agencies to combat these fraudulent acts and bring the culprits to book.
Once again we implore all our customers to desist from sharing any sensitive information with any individual under the guise of an OPay staff.

A Message To Our Aggregators
Our mission remains the same - to financially and socially include everyone without regard for physical borders, boundaries or social status.
SHARE THIS ARTICLE
We understand that we have put out a series of new policies concerning aggregators in the recent short time. We believe that providing more context will enable you to appreciate the policies.
OPay’s focus in the future will be on you – our aggregators. For this, we are creating a platform where hardworking and capable aggregators can reap enormous success from their efforts, more so than anywhere else. We need to do so in ways that allow us to have a business and share our profits and value generously to create a long-term partnership with you.
To do so, we will do two things: Firstly, we will increase the commission that you receive and then give you the ability to develop aggregators under you to build a large-scale business for yourself.
We had announced policies to ‘buy’ new terminals or ‘top-up’ your existing ones: initially increasing the deposits/price for the terminals – this measure enabled us to identify the more committed aggregators. Once the terminal fulfils its lifetime transaction requirement, you will get the FULL deposits back as a refund.
The whole time, you will get a commission that is 3-4 times higher than the next competitor platform in the market. This means that one year with OPay equals 3-4 years with other platforms.
Secondly, we are giving you the privilege to be OPay’s 'Direct Aggregators', where you can, in turn, develop your very own sub-aggregators, who can help you develop agents much faster.
We trust this allows you to create a mini-platform for yourselves and enable you to become a sizable business owner. Typically, you can be more successful as an aggregator by developing a ‘team’ of sub-aggregators than by merely developing your own agents. OPay will give you the whole platform of tools to manage and monitor your sub-aggregators, determine your commissions, and manage your business.
With these tools, if you are a performing aggregator, you will be more successful on the OPay platform, and you will achieve your financial goals faster than anywhere else. Feel free to test us out.
We will continue to explain our policies and tools and answer your questions in the coming days. We will also host a series of local physical meetings and fora with aggregators to listen to your suggestions and feedback. As we innovate boldly, we look to have your feedback and continually improve your suggestions and feedback.
Lastly, please be assured that OPay does not – and never will – deduct your commission in a non-transparent manner. For any questions on your commission, please kindly contact your Aggregator Manager or our Customer Service.
OPay’s mission has always been to financially and socially include everyone without regard for physical borders, boundaries or social status. We will continue to keep this promise in our partnership with you.",blog

Reasons Why People Fall for Financial Scams
Fraudsters play on peoples emotions, from greed to goodwill. Hence, why innocent people fall for these schemes.
SHARE THIS ARTICLE
Intelligent people become victims to these too good to be actual scams. Financial scams cost individuals, organisations and even government agencies billions of Naira every year; these scams do not discriminate against age, gender or geographical location. In one way or the other, most Nigerians have encountered at least one of the fraudulent activities emphasised here.
Renowned author and expert on financial scams, Stephen Greenspan wrote a book called Annals of Gullibility: Why We Get Duped and How to Avoid It. This insightful book came out in December of 2008 but guess what? Ironically, less than a month after (the book launch) he fell victim to the most significant financial fraud scheme in history. When Bernie Madoff’s Ponzi scheme (largest Ponzi scheme in history) finally fell apart. He lost a large chunk of his retirement savings to Madoff.
This is just one in a million stories about how people, regardless of how intelligent they are, fall for financial scams. No one is immune to fraud; unfortunately, there is no vaccine against fraud. Here are the three most common reasons why people like you and I are susceptible to fraud schemes.
The urge to make money without doing anything
Everyone would love the opportunity to earn more money without having to move a muscle. However, making money takes effort and the right intentions. Fraudsters often attract victims with exciting offers that simply do not exist and offer you an opportunity to triple your income by taking action or clicking on an unverified link.
Double their money without knowing the source of revenue
Making money takes work; the commitment may vary however, you should not expect to invest N5,000 naira in an investment scheme and make N30,000 in 24 hours. We hate to break it to you, but this is a SCAM. When an investment scheme seems too good to be true, then you should be more careful because it has a 99.9% chance of being too good to be true.
**(FOMO) The Fear of Missing Out **
Human nature is worried about missing out on the next ‘big thing’ or a scheme that offers exciting returns within a limited time. People are naturally drawn to this type of offer, so fraudsters have taken advantage of this to offer people schemes that are only valid within a particular time frame. Another common tactic fraudsters use is employing others to give testimonials about how their investment platform transformed their lives. In most cases, these people are also culprits. Do not let FOMO blind you into investing your hard-earned money into a fraudulent investment platform.
Fraudsters will always act friendly to gain your trust and confidence before asking you for money. At the end of the day, it is your money, and no one cares about it as much as you do.
Remember to perform your due diligence and verify the platform before making a financial decision.
Here are some ways to make sure you do not fall victim to fraudsters and how to detect fraud.",blog

How to Detect Fraud and the Right Actions to Take
The easiest way to detect Fraud and the actions you should take.
SHARE THIS ARTICLE
The payment landscape in Africa is rapidly changing with the rise in the number of financial institutions, the number of digital transactions and the popularity of Fintech. At OPay, while we do so much to ensure our users have access to real-time payments, convenient and seamless means of performing transactions. We put in the extra effort to make sure every single transaction is secure and encrypted.
As we keep coming up with innovative ways to build and secure our products, some people are actively looking for new means to defraud unsuspicious people of their hard-earned money. Even social media has amplified these fraudulent activities.
So here is a guide to help you detect the red flags and understand the right actions to take.
So here is a guide to help you detect the red flags and understand the right actions to take.
Money Doubling or Ponzi Schemes: This is a prevalent scenario whereby you receive a phone call or join a social media group that claims you can save with the platform, and your money will be doubled in minutes or days. For example, deposit N20,000 to receive N40,000 in 2 hours. OPay is not a money doubling platform, and we will never encourage any user to partake in any of these investment programs.
Phishing Attacks: Scammers can use emails or text messages to trick you into giving up your personal information. Phishing scams often send links within the messages. Once clicked, you grant access to your personal information or a prompt to fill a form manually with sensitive information such as; your BVN, account number, date of birth, OTP etc.
Advance Fee Schemes: A growing trend from fraudsters involves asking unsuspecting users to pay upfront for a product or service without rendering that service.
Identity Theft: Identity theft occurs when fraudsters have access to your personal and sensitive information. With this information, they can access your account to perform transactions on your behalf.
Debit or Card Fraud: Debit or credit card fraud occurs when your card details are compromised, lost or stolen.
How to Protect Yourself
Do not give out your OTP, password and transaction details to anyone.
Do not respond to calls, emails or messages from fraudsters claiming to be an OPay representative.
Do not invest your hard-earned funds in any Ponzi, investment or pyramid schemes.
Do not pay money to anyone claiming to be an OPay representative with the promise of fast-tracking your POS application.
Stay vigilant at all times; if you suspect your account might have been compromised, send an email to our compliance team at antifraud@opay-inc.com.
We understand that fraud is a major challenge in the financial sector, that’s why we are constantly innovating and creating new ways to protect our customers.

OPay Merchants: How to Spot Fake Naira Notes
A simple guide for OPay Merchants to identify and spot counterfeit naira notes.
SHARE THIS ARTICLE
We have seen an emerging trend in fraudsters creating, distributing and using fake currencies as payment methods. This unlocked level of counterfeiting has cost merchants a lot of money as they bear the entire burden of the loss. Counterfeit currency is a severe threat, and we strongly advise our merchants not to be complacent about it. It is also vital to know that fake notes are not only printed in large denominations (N1,000); they can also be printed in smaller denominations like N50, N100, N200 and N500.
Although counterfeiters’ techniques seem to be improving these days, the notes can be detected. Here’s a simple guide to help you identify genuine naira notes printed and circulated by the Central Bank of Nigeria.
*Here are some ways to spot
Check the Texture
Fake naira notes are typically made from ordinary paper, while genuine notes are made from a special kind of paper. It is essential to check the quality and texture of the notes received before accepting them as payment for a service.
Use Water or Other Liquid
If you are suspicious of a note received, dip it into water or petrol and scrub gently with your thumb. If the money is fake, the colour will wash off easily. Actual notes are water-resistant; hence the colours will not wash off.
Check the Ribbon
Every genuine naira note has a silver ribbon embedded from the top to the bottom of the naira note. With real notes, the thread can be felt; even in old naira notes, this thread is still visible. However, in fake notes, something looks like a thread, but it’s just the paint. Try scratching that ribbon, and it comes off easily.
Use Mercury Bulb
There are other features of the naira note that can’t be seen with naked eyes. These features can only be seen on genuine naira notes and can only be visible with some pieces of equipment. With the use of mercury bulbs, you can spot the difference between fake and real notes.
It is also important to note that the use of counterfeit notes is punishable under the Nigerian constitution. It does not matter if you are aware or not because ignorance is not an excuse in the Nigerian court of law.

Frequently Asked Questions About the OPay Merchant Loans
Here are a few things you should know about the OPay Merchant Loan.
SHARE THIS ARTICLE
What is OPay Merchant Loan?
OPay Merchant loan enables merchants to get access to quick loans of up to N5 million directly on the OPay app. OPay has partnered with Blue Ridge Microfinance Bank to aid the loan process.
What does 'partnered with Blue Ridge Microfinance Bank' for OPay Merchant Loans mean for you?
To help meet our Merchant’s cash flow needs, OPay offers two types of loans through our MFB partner (Blue Ridge Microfinance Bank). The loan agreement will be with Blue Ridge. However, the funds will be deposited into your OPay Merchant wallet, and repayments will be automatically be transferred to Blue Ridge.
In practice, you’ll request your funds in the OPay App and receive your funds and make your repayments from your OPay merchant wallet. OPay will handle all communications with Blue Ridge’s systems to create your loan, send the funds to your wallet and send your repayments to Blue Ridge.
What are the different types of loans available on the OPay Merchant Loans?
There are two types of loans available on the OPay Merchant Loans on OPay;
Short and Long-term loans.
How does a Short-term loan work?
Short-Term Loans will enable you to select a loan amount up to your pre-approved credit limit. The short-term loans are usually due by midnight on the day after the loan was paid into your wallet with a flat fee of 0.3%. As a merchant, you can access up to N1 million daily with the OPay merchant loan.
How does the Long-term loan work?
The long-term merchant loan gives you the option of borrowing funds within a 28–42 days timeframe, enabling you to select a loan amount up to your pre-approved credit limit.
How will I get the Loan when it has been approved?
Once your loan has been approved, you will get the agreed amount in your OPay wallet.
How can I Increase my loan limit?
You can increase your loan limit by actively using the OPay app or POS to perform transactions like; withdrawals, transfers and bill payments.
What are the interest rates and fees associated with OPay Merchant Loans?
The overall interest rates may vary from time to time as economic conditions and default trends change, but we aim to be as transparent as possible with the costs and fees associated with your Merchant Loans. We’ll publish them and be sure to notify you if they are changing in the future.
28–42 Day Loan
The interest fee for 28–42 day loans is dependent on your merchant level, which is defined by the status of your POS sales. Merchant levels will be updated once per calendar month, and once your merchant level changes, you can expect to see the interest fee updated for your next loan.
Also, if you’re unable to pay your loan in full by the due date, you’ll incur a weekly late fee beginning after a 7-day grace period. That also varies per your merchant level. That means that as you grow your OPay POS business, you’ll gain access to lower rates and additional capital!
How can I update my Merchant level?
There are different types of merchants on OPay; Regular, Gold, and Platinum. The Gold and Platinum merchant levels are defined by the OPay POS sales in a given calendar month. Once you pass a threshold in a given calendar month, you’ll be eligible for the lower rate and once merchant levels are updated in the following month. We’ll update the levels on the first business day of the next month.
We also know that businesses will see some fluctuation from month to month, so once you have reached the Gold or Platinum level, you’ll remain at that level until your production has dropped below the POS Sales Threshold for 2 consecutive calendar months. Once you increase your business production again — we’ll move you right back after 1 month above the set threshold.
How do I repay my OPay Merchant Loan?
Once you have received the funds for your OPay Merchant Loan, you’ll repay them any time. When you visit the 'My Account' page for your OPay Merchant Loans account, you’ll see any outstanding loans listed. You can simply click 'Repay' to see the options available for repayment.
Suppose your loan reaches the due date and has not yet been paid in full. In that case, OPay will begin to automatically deduct the remaining balance from your OPay merchant wallet until the amount owing is satisfied in full.
How much can I borrow?
Merchant Loans are only available once you’ve been using the OPay POS to perform transactions for at least 60 days to enable you to learn enough about your mobile money banking business and to determine credit limits.",blog

A Stool in the Lab
Our chief compliance officer, Olaniyi Alao, gives an overview of the key role compliance plays in building a successful product or service.
SHARE THIS ARTICLE
'If you are not at the table, you are likely on the menu.' -Anonymous
Compliance teams are not usually liked. We carry the burden of being the hated guys that love to say, 'No’, and also thrive with the badge of being 'snoopers'. The disdain is not restricted to the Product or the Marketing/Sales team as the 'love-hate' relationship extends to the IT guys too — when it comes to work-related relationship. The IT guys sometimes feel the Compliance guys are unappreciative and all they look forward to is saying, 'No, this cannot work'. A friend once asked if we were wired to say, No, especially when they feel we should be able to do this.
In building a product or providing a service in a regulated environment, it is essential to provide a stool to the Compliance Team in your construction stage. Do not worry, the Compliance Team can only join you on-site — we will wear the helmets (What’s the colour of the day?). At this stage when ideas are being mixed and flying around, you need someone focusing your attention on the guidelines that apply to such product or service. The amendments can come in here, and you would also be advised how we can make the product or service work without incurring the regulators’ wrath.
In the same vein, the IT guys cannot develop a Compliance tool if Compliance had no input. Everyone understands that you developed the idea. However, the Compliance team is the user. In development, stakeholders (especially Compliance) should be part of the board placing process.
The process should begin with Compliance in mind. Put it all on the table — 'we have this idea guys. how do we make it work?' I am not sure there is any Compliance team that is against the entity making profits. You likely have a Compliance team that does not want the profits to be coughed out in fines/sanctions. https://finbold.com/bank-fines-2020/.
With this, the cart is not placed before the horse. The Compliance Team would always provide you with reasons and regulations that do not align with such product or services — since the Compliance team is the team that runs around when the sanctions arrive. I tell people that the approach is usually wrong, hence why the 'Kings of No' would tell you, No!
Both parties need to convince one another and the focus has to be on the organisation.
Do we want to earn a quick buck and lose that to sanctions? Are we ready to put our reputation on the line and respond to a deluge of enquiries from partners?
Due to the adrenaline rush of finding a product that could 'change the game', it is sometimes tempting to forget the potential risks and focus so much on the benefits. It is therefore important to have someone who draws your attention to this during the building process.
Each product or service must have a balance of risks against benefits — take your spots Compliance and Products. Whilst the product team may have tidied the risks inherent in the products, it is usually possible to forget the channels of delivery of the products or the risks of third-party vendors — here comes due diligence. In addition, certain regulatory issues carry increased risk. For example, the new product or service may raise concerns about the fair treatment of or impact on consumers. What about the collection of data or Data Protection issues?
In conclusion, I believe it’s a matter of both parties listening to each other — the ringing question should be, 'how do we do this such that we do not lose?'
Eyes on the profit my friend!

How to Improve your Financial Status
These few tips an help improve your financial status.
SHARE THIS ARTICLE
2021 is moving quickly, in the twinkle of an eye and we are in the second month of the year. 2020 was a challenging, unforgettable and unpredictable year, and folks are still struggling with the cycle of debts or trying to bounce back from the festive period’s financial burden. Moving forward seems like a daunting task, especially during this pandemic period. However, with a little more discipline and making wise financial decisions, you can get back on track.
To shape or plan your financial goals, you have to be realistic, accountable, and disciplined.
Everyone wants to be financially stable, but the most frequently asked question. Remains, how?
Well, don’t be discouraged-you can improve your financial status if you take several small steps.
Draw out a plan
For everything you want to do, you need to develop a plan. Ask yourself, what do you want to achieve? What do you stand to gain if this works out? While planning, remember to give it a timeline or timeframe; this helps you stay committed and disciplined.
Automate Savings
This should be your top priority, especially if you don’t have a solid emergency fund yet. Make it the first bill you pay each payday by having a set amount transferred from your current account to your savings (automate your savings on OWealth or FlexiFixed). Don’t even think about this transaction; make sure it happens every payday.
Control your impulse spending
The biggest problem for many of us is impulse spending. Eating out, shopping and, online purchases is a significant financial drain, the biggest budget breaker for many, and a sure way to be in dire financial straits. With total control and discipline, your impulse spending can be limited and effectively minimized.
Evaluate your expenses, and live frugally
If you’ve never tracked your expenses, try a One Month Challenge. Then evaluate how you are spending your money, and see what you can cut out or reduce. Decide if each expense is necessary, then eliminate the unnecessary.
Personal finance rules will undoubtedly help you take control of your finance and improve your financial status in the long run.
Remember, you can save and earn up to 12% interest return with our savings products OWealth or FlexiFixed.

Traditional Banking Vs. Digital Banking
The Technology revolution has transformed our everyday lives, and the banking industry is not an exception.
SHARE THIS ARTICLE
The Technology revolution has transformed our everyday lives, and the banking industry is not an exception.
Banking itself has been in existence since the 1600s, perhaps even before that, in one form or the other. There has always been a means of performing basic transactions and exchanging money for goods and services from the days of cowries, coins down to the current naira notes we use in exchange for goods and services. Banks were created as a necessity to provide loans and credit as well as reduce exploitation by money lenders to the general public.
There is no doubt that digital disruption is no longer just a change in the ways of life but a shift towards a more convenient way of performing daily transactions.
Although some banks still perform the traditional banking method, it has been necessary to upgrade their mode of operation, hence introducing bank apps and the use of USSD codes for easy payments. Welcome to Digital!
Traditional banking can no longer be maintained if it does not update its services and adapt to the demands of increasingly digitized consumer profiles. Banks have also had to go through the digital transformation process and introduce digital banking elements to their services.
Traditional banking was, no doubt, a lifesaver. Back in the days, we had everything payment-related at the grip of our hands; so far, we visited the banks. At some point, it was the most convenient and reliable form of banking, but take a look at the world today, the world has gone digital over 112 million Nigerians now have access to the internet. Hence, bill payments and transfers are made within a snap of a finger with records to keep track of it all.
There is no doubt that Digital Banking is gaining more and more weight within the financial market, thereby attracting more customers and investors from all over the world.
Traditional Banking and Digital Banking are both titans. Still, with the advancement of technology, everyday Digital Banking is the trojan horse taking over the world. It is happening so fast that most people are beginning to let go of Traditional Banking entirely.
Digital Banking is why we now have a surge in new entrants in the Fintech ecosystem, making and creating a platform where the banked and unbanked can have access to easy and seamless financial services regardless of time and place.
